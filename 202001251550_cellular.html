Here, we report POLR2A, the largest catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II, as a major target gene down-regulated after XAB2 depletion. XAB2 depletion led to severe splicing defects of POLR2A with significant intron retention. Such defects resulted in substantial loss of POLR2A at RNA and protein levels, which further impaired global transcription. Treatment of splicing inhibitor madrasin induced similar reduction of POLR2A. Screen using TMT-based quantitative proteomics identified several proteins involved in mRNA surveillance including Dom34 with elevated expression. Inhibition of translation or depletion of Dom34 rescued the expression of POLR2A by stabilizing its mRNA. Immuno-precipitation further confirmed that XAB2 associated with spliceosome components important to POLR2A expression. Domain mapping revealed that TPR motifs 2-4 and 11 of XAB2 were critical for POLR2A expression by interacting with SNW1. Finally, we showed POLR2A mediated cell senescence caused by XAB2 deficiency. Depletion of XAB2 or POLR2A induced cell senescence by up-regulation of p53 and p21, re-expression of POLR2A after XAB2 depletion alleviated cellular senescence. These data together support that XAB2 serves as a guardian of POLR2A expression to ensure global gene expression and antagonize cell senescence.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Hou, Dajun Qu, Yue Li, Baohui Zhu, Dapeng Liang, Xinyue Wei, Wei Tang, Qian Zhang, Jiaojiao Hao, Wei Guo, Weijie Wang, Siqi Zhao, Qi Wang, Sikandar Azam, Misbah Khan, Haidong Zhao, Liye Zhang, Haixin Lei<br><b>Journal:</b> Nucleic Acids Res.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1362-4962<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.14<br><b>SJR:</b> 8.636<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216022">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Small Extracellular Vesicles Are Key Regulators of Non-cell Autonomous Intercellular Communication in Senescence via the Interferon Protein IFITM3.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Senescence is a cellular phenotype present in health and disease, characterized by a stable cell-cycle arrest and an inflammatory response called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP is important in influencing the behavior of neighboring cells and altering the microenvironment; yet, this role has been mainly attributed to soluble factors. Here, we show that both the soluble factors and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are capable of transmitting paracrine senescence to nearby cells. Analysis of individual cells internalizing sEVs, using a Cre-reporter system, show a positive correlation between sEV uptake and senescence activation. We find an increase in the number of multivesicular bodies during senescence in vivo. sEV protein characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) followed by a functional siRNA screen identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as being partially responsible for transmitting senescence to normal cells. We find that sEVs contribute to paracrine senescence.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Michela Borghesan, Juan Fafián-Labora, Olga Eleftheriadou, Paula Carpintero-Fernández, Marta Paez-Ribes, Gema Vizcay-Barrena, Avital Swisa, Dror Kolodkin-Gal, Pilar Ximénez-Embún, Robert Lowe, Belen Martín-Martín, Hector Peinado, Javier Muñoz, Roland A Fleck, Yuval Dor, Ittai Ben-Porath, Anna Vossenkamper, Daniel Muñoz-Espin, Ana O'Loghlen<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2211-1247<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.70<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.635<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242426">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The innate immune sensor Toll-like receptor 2 controls the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cellular senescence is a stress response program characterized by a robust cell cycle arrest and the induction of a proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that is triggered through an unknown mechanism.

However, mammalian MGs do not exhibit such a proliferative and regenerative ability. Here, we identify Hippo pathway-mediated repression of the transcription cofactor YAP as a core regulatory mechanism that normally blocks mammalian MG proliferation and cellular reprogramming. MG-specific deletion of Hippo pathway components Lats1 and Lats2, as well as transgenic expression of a Hippo non-responsive form of YAP (YAP5SA), resulted in dramatic Cyclin D1 upregulation, loss of adult MG identity, and attainment of a highly proliferative, progenitor-like cellular state.

Recent studies disclosed the emerging roles of heat-shock proteins in regulating muscle regeneration and homeostasis. Here, we found that Hsp90β, but not Hsp90α isoform, was significantly upregulated during muscle regeneration. RNA-seq analysis disclosed a transcriptional elevation of p21 in Hsp90β-depleted myoblasts, which is due to the upregulation of p53. Moreover, knockdown of Hsp90β in myoblasts resulted in p53-dependent cellular senescence. In contrast to the notion that Hsp90 interacts with and protects mutant p53 in cancer, Hsp90β preferentially bound to wild-type p53 and modulated its degradation via a proteasome-dependent manner. Moreover, Hsp90β interacted with MDM2, the chief E3 ligase of p53, to regulate the stability of p53. In line with these in vitro studies, the expression level of p53-p21 axis was negatively correlated with Hsp90β in aged mice muscle. Consistently, administration of 17-AAG, a Hsp90 inhibitor under clinical trial, impaired muscle regeneration by enhancing injury-induced senescence in vivo. Taken together, our finding revealed a previously unappreciated role of Hsp90β in regulating p53 stability to suppress senescence both in vitro and in vivo.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Min Yi He, Shui Bo Xu, Zi Hao Qu, Yue Mei Guo, Xiao Ceng Liu, Xiao Xia Cong, Jian Feng Wang, Boon Chuan Low, Li Li, Qiang Wu, Peng Lin, Shi Gui Yan, Zhang Bao, Yi Ting Zhou, Li Ling Zheng<br><b>Journal:</b> Aging Cell<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1474-9726<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.08<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.809<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313490">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Targeting senescent cells in translational medicine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Organismal ageing is a complex process driving progressive impairment of functionality and regenerative potential of tissues. Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest occurring in response to damage and stress and is considered a hallmark of ageing. Senescent cells accumulate in multiple organs during ageing, contribute to tissue dysfunction and give rise to pathological manifestations. Senescence is therefore a defining feature of a variety of human age-related disorders, including cancer, and targeted elimination of these cells has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to ameliorate tissue damage and promote repair and regeneration. In addition, in vivo identification of senescent cells has significant potential for early diagnosis of multiple pathologies. Here, we review existing senolytics, small molecules and drug delivery tools used in preclinical therapeutic strategies involving cellular senescence, as well as probes to trace senescent cells. We also review the clinical research landscape in senescence and discuss how identifying and targeting cellular senescence might positively affect pathological and ageing processes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Marta Paez-Ribes, Estela González-Gualda, Gary J Doherty, Daniel Muñoz-Espín<br><b>Journal:</b> EMBO Mol Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-4684<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 10.28<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.033<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31746100">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Direct reprogramming into interneurons: potential for brain repair.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The brain tissue has only a limited capacity for generating new neurons. Therefore, to treat neurological diseases, there is a need of other cell sources for brain repair. Different sources of cells have been subject of intense research over the years, including cells from primary tissue, stem cell-derived cells and reprogrammed cells. As an alternative, direct reprogramming of resident brain cells into neurons is a recent approach that could provide an attractive method for treating brain injuries or diseases as it uses the patient's own cells for generating novel neurons inside the brain. In vivo reprogramming is still in its early stages but holds great promise as an option for cell therapy. To date, both inhibitory and excitatory neurons have been obtained via in vivo reprogramming, but the precise phenotype or functionality of these cells has not been analysed in detail in most of the studies. Recent data shows that in vivo reprogrammed neurons are able to functionally mature and integrate into the existing brain circuitry, and compose interneuron phenotypes that seem to correlate to their endogenous counterparts. Interneurons are of particular importance as they are essential in physiological brain function and when disturbed lead to several neurological disorders. In this review, we describe a comprehensive overview of the existing studies involving brain repair, including in vivo reprogramming, with a focus on interneurons, along with an overview on current efforts to generate interneurons for cell therapy for a number of neurological diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria Pereira, Marcella Birtele, Daniella Rylander Ottosson<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell.

Many studies have demonstrated the detrimental effects of apoE4 in varying cellular contexts. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining how apoE4 leads to cognitive decline are not fully understood. Recently, the combination of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) modeling of neurological diseases in vitro and electrophysiological studies in vivo have begun to unravel the intersection between apoE4, neuronal subtype dysfunction or loss, subsequent network deficits, and eventual cognitive decline. In this review, we provide an overview of the literature describing apoE4's detrimental effects in the central nervous system (CNS), specifically focusing on its contribution to neuronal subtype dysfunction or loss. We focus on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus, which are selectively vulnerable to apoE4-mediated neurotoxicity. Additionally, we discuss the importance of the GABAergic inhibitory network to proper cognitive function and how dysfunction of this network manifests in AD. Finally, we examine how apoE4-mediated GABAergic interneuron loss can lead to inhibitory network deficits and how this deficit results in cognitive decline. We propose the following working model: Aging and/or stress induces neuronal expression of apoE. GABAergic interneurons are selectively vulnerable to intracellularly produced apoE4, through a tau dependent mechanism, which leads to their dysfunction and eventual death. In turn, GABAergic interneuron loss causes hyperexcitability and dysregulation of neural networks in the hippocampus and cortex. This dysfunction results in learning, memory, and other cognitive deficits that are the central features of AD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Ramsey Najm, Emily A Jones, Yadong Huang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Neurodegener<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1750-1326<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 8.38<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.988<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186040">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MYC competes with MiT/TFE in regulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy through an epigenetic rheostat.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Coordinated regulation of the lysosomal and autophagic systems ensures basal catabolism and normal cell physiology, and failure of either system causes disease. Here we describe an epigenetic rheostat orchestrated by c-MYC and histone deacetylases that inhibits lysosomal and autophagic biogenesis by concomitantly repressing the expression of the transcription factors MiT/TFE and FOXH1, and that of lysosomal and autophagy genes. Inhibition of histone deacetylases abates c-MYC binding to the promoters of lysosomal and autophagy genes, granting promoter occupancy to the MiT/TFE members, TFEB and TFE3, and/or the autophagy regulator FOXH1. In pluripotent stem cells and cancer, suppression of lysosomal and autophagic function is directly downstream of c-MYC overexpression and may represent a hallmark of malignant transformation. We propose that, by determining the fate of these catabolic systems, this hierarchical switch regulates the adaptive response of cells to pathological and physiological cues that could be exploited therapeutically.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Ida Annunziata, Diantha van de Vlekkert, Elmar Wolf, David Finkelstein, Geoffrey Neale, Eda Machado, Rosario Mosca, Yvan Campos, Heather Tillman, Martine F Roussel, Jason Andrew Weesner, Leigh Ellen Fremuth, Xiaohui Qiu, Min-Joon Han, Gerard C Grosveld, Alessandra d'Azzo<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399583">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The transcription factor Slug represses p16<br><b>Abstract:</b> Activation of the p16<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Pei Zhu, Chunping Zhang, Yongxing Gao, Furen Wu, Yalu Zhou, Wen-Shu Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189923">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Loci for human leukocyte telomere length in the Singaporean Chinese population and trans-ethnic genetic studies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Genetic factors underlying leukocyte telomere length (LTL) may provide insights into telomere homeostasis, with direct links to disease susceptibility.

However, the causal genes in these loci have not been systematically interrogated. We conducted a high-throughput RNA-interference functional screen to identify the genes essential for proliferation in the CRC risk loci of Asian populations. We found that ATF1, located in the 12q13.12 region, functions as an oncogene that facilitates cell proliferation; ATF1 has the most significant effect of the identified genes and promotes CRC xenograft growth by affecting cell apoptosis.
