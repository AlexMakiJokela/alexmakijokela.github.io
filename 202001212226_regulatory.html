Given that GMSCs have a robust immune regulatory function and regenerative ability, we investigated the effect of GMSCs on preventing T cell-mediated bone marrow failure (BMF) in a mouse model. We observed that GMSCs markedly improved mice survival and attenuated histological bone marrow (BM) damage. Moreover, we found GMSCs significantly reduced cell infiltration of CD8+ cells, Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas increased CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation in lymph nodes. GMSCs also suppressed the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17A and IL-6, but IL-10 was increased in serum.

The interaction between CSCs/CICs and tumor microenvironment (TME) can sustain "stemness" properties and promote their survival and plasticity. This cross-talk is also pivotal in regulating and modulating CSC/CIC properties. This review will provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying the mutual interaction between CSCs/CICs and TME. Particular focus will be dedicated to the immunological profile of CSCs/CICs and its role in orchestrating cancer immunosurveillance. Moreover, the available immunotherapy strategies that can target CSCs/CICs and of their possible implementation will be discussed. Overall, the dissection of the mechanisms regulating the CSC/CIC-TME interaction is warranted to understand the plasticity and immunoregulatory properties of stem-like tumor cells and to achieve complete eradications of tumors through the optimization of immunotherapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Shilpa Ravindran, Saad Rasool, Cristina Maccalli<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancer Microenviron<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1875-2292<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.57<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.00<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.759<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31758404">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> CBFβ/RUNX3-miR10b-TIAM1 molecular axis inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive system. A deeper understanding of the mechanism of proliferation and metastasis is needed to improve patient survival. T cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1) has been proven to play an essential role in the proliferation and metastasis of GC. The aim of this study was to explore the relevant upstream regulatory mechanism of TIAM1. Bioinformatic analysis, RT-qPCR, and dual luciferase reporter assays were used to predict and validate microRNAs that target the TIAM1 gene. Among eleven predicted microRNAs, eight (miR-10b-5p, miR-589-3p, miR-651-3p, miR-335-3p, miR-653-5p, miR-373-3p, miR-372-3p, and miR-205-3p) affected TIAM1 expression; and only miR-10b-5p regulated TIAM1 expression by directly binding to the 3'-UTR of TIAM1 mRNA. miR-10b-5p levels were determined in both normal and cancerous tissues retrieved from GC patients. We observed that by targeting TIAM1 expression, miR-10b-5p inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells. To verify our observations, we evaluated the participation of runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), a known regulator of microRNA expression and tumor suppressor. Tumor-suppressor RUNX3 combined with core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFβ) upregulated miR-10b-5p and suppressed GC. In conclusion, we identified a CBFβ/RUNX3-miR10b-TIAM1 molecular axis that inhibits GC progression and metastasis and may provide suitable treatment targets for GC.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Gaofeng Hu, Yanfen Shi, Xu Zhao, Dandan Gao, Linlin Qu, Lijun Chen, Ke Zhao, Juan Du, Wei Xu<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Clin Exp Pathol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1936-2625<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.57<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.19<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.393<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31934163">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Arf1-mediated lipid metabolism sustains cancer cells and its ablation induces anti-tumor immune responses in mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may be responsible for treatment resistance, tumor metastasis, and disease recurrence. Here we demonstrate that the Arf1-mediated lipid metabolism sustains cells enriched with CSCs and its ablation induces anti-tumor immune responses in mice. Notably, Arf1 ablation in cancer cells induces mitochondrial defects, endoplasmic-reticulum stress, and the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which recruit and activate dendritic cells (DCs) at tumor sites. The activated immune system finally elicits antitumor immune surveillance by stimulating T-cell infiltration and activation. Furthermore, TCGA data analysis shows an inverse correlation between Arf1 expression and T-cell infiltration and activation along with patient survival in various human cancers. Our results reveal that Arf1-pathway knockdown not only kills CSCs but also elicits a tumor-specific immune response that converts dying CSCs into a therapeutic vaccine, leading to durable benefits.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Guohao Wang, Junji Xu, Jiangsha Zhao, Weiqin Yin, Dayong Liu, WanJun Chen, Steven X Hou<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.51<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31924786">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Differentiation induction of human breast cancer cells by arsenite in combination with tetrandrine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: To provide novel insight into the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat breast cancer, differentiation-inducing activity of clinically achievable concentrations of arsenite (As

The transcriptional reactivation of HERVs is mainly an effect of their responsiveness to some factors in cell microenvironment, such as nutrients, hormones and cytokines. We have already demonstrated that, under pressure of microenvironmental changes, HERV-K (HML-2) activation is required to maintain human melanoma cell plasticity and CD133+ cancer stem cells survival. In the present study, the transcriptional activity of HERV-K (HML-2), HERV-H, CD133 and the embryonic transcription factors OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 was evaluated during the in vitro treatment with antiretroviral drugs in cells from melanoma, liver and lung cancers exposed to microenvironmental changes. The exposure to stem cell medium induced a phenotype switching with the generation of sphere-like aggregates, characterized by the concomitant increase of HERV-K (HML-2) and HERV-H, CD133 and embryonic genes transcriptional activity. Although with heterogenic response among the different cell lines, the in vitro treatment with antiretroviral drugs affected HERVs transcriptional activity in parallel with the reduction of CD133 and embryonic genes expression, clonogenic activity and cell growth, accompanied by the induction of apoptosis. The responsiveness to antiretroviral drugs treatment of cancer cells with stemness features and expressing HERVs suggests the use of these drugs as innovative approach to treat aggressive tumours in combination with chemotherapeutic/radiotherapy regimens.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Giovinazzo, Emanuela Balestrieri, Vita Petrone, Ayele Argaw-Denboba, Chiara Cipriani, Martino Tony Miele, Sandro Grelli, Paola Sinibaldi-Vallebona, Claudia Matteucci<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancer Microenviron<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1875-2292<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.51<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.00<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.759<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691184">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Myeloid and Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells and Cancer - New Insights.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Dendritic cells (DCs) use effective mechanisms to combat antigens and to bring about adaptive immune responses through their ability to stimulate näive T cells.

Thus, we have used retroviral transduction of a specific T cell receptor, single-chain variable fragments (Fvs), or antigen domains in Tregs to achieve this goal.

EC can be divided into two subtypes, endometroid EC and serous-like EC, with distinct histological characterizations and molecular phenotypes. There is an increasing awareness that serous-like EC resembles serous OvCa in genetic landscape, but a clear relationship between them is still lacking.
Methods: Here, we took advantage of the large-scale molecular profiling of The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) to compare the two EC subtypes and serous OvCa. We used bioinformatics data analytic methods to systematically examine the somatic mutation (SM) and copy number alteration (SCNA), gene expression, pathway activities, survival gene signatures and immune infiltration. Based on these quantifiable molecular characterizations, we asked whether serous-like EC should be grouped more closely to serous OvCa, based on the context of being serous-like; or if should be grouped more closely to endometroid EC, based on the same organ origin.
Results: We found that although serous-like EC and serous OvCa share some common genotypes, including mutation and copy number alteration, they differ in molecular phenotypes such as gene expression and signaling pathway activity. Moreover, no shared prognostic gene signature was found, indicating that they use unique genes governing tumor progression. Finally, although the endometrioid EC and serous OvCa are both highly immune infiltrated, the immune cell composition in serous OvCa is mostly immune suppressive, whereas endometrioid EC has a higher level of cytotoxic immune cells. Overall, our genetic aberration and molecular phenotype characterizations indicated that serous-like EC and serous OvCa cannot be simply treated as a simple "serous" cancer type. In particular, additional attention should be paid to their unique gene activities and tumor microenvironments for novel targeted therapy development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Hui Zhong, Huiyu Chen, Huahong Qiu, Chen Huang, Zhihui Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> PeerJ<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2167-8359<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.4<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.34<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.037<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31942259">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Imbalance of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg during the development of uterine cervical cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Uterine cervical cancer (UCC) causes more than one quarter of a million deaths per year in many developing countries. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer result from infection with the human papillomavirus. After high-risk HPV infection, most HPV infections are cleared naturally as a result of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Only a limited number of patients' cervical lesions progress through CIN to cervical cancer, from persistent oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This indicated that immunoregulation may play a central role in the HPV-induced carcinogenesis. However, the natural history of clearance of a cervical HPV infection or its progression to a UCC needs clarification. We examined the related immune cells (Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells) and related immune factors (INF-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23, TGF-βI) of UCC patients, CIN patients, HPV infected patients, and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, patients with UCC or CIN had a lower proportion of Th1 cells, and a higher proportion of Th2, Th17, and Treg cells. IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 and TGF-βI concentrations in serum were found to be increased from patients with UCC or CIN, while INF-γ concentration in serum with UCC or CIN decreased. Our findings suggested that there were attractive imbalances of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cells in UCC and CIN patients. HPV persistent infection induced an immunologic dissonance, and the degree of imbalance is aggravated with the progression of the disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Wei Lin, Zhaoyuan Niu, Hualing Zhang, Yan Kong, Zhen Wang, Xingsheng Yang, Fang Yuan<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Clin Exp Pathol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1936-2625<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.4<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.19<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.393<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31934210">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> PTCy ameliorates GVHD by restoring regulatory and effector T-cell homeostasis in recipients with PD-1 blockade.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical mediators of immune tolerance after allo-HSCT. Clinical studies have indicated that programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade before allo-HSCT involves a risk of severe GVHD. However, the mechanisms underlying GVHD induction resulting from PD-1 blockade remain unclear. We investigated the impact of PD-1 expression of donor T cells on T-cell reconstitution and GVHD using murine models. We first demonstrated that inhibition of PD-1 signaling induced aggressive expansion of CD4+ conventional T cells; however, Tregs could not maintain expansion because of high susceptibility to apoptosis, resulting in discordant immune recovery and subsequent development of severe GVHD. We then evaluated the impact of posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on abnormal T-cell reconstitution after PD-1 blockade. PTCy efficiently ameliorated GVHD after transplantation from a PD-1-/- donor and extended overall survival by safely regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of T-cell subsets. Notably, in the first 2 weeks after administration of PTCy, Tregs regained their ability to continuously proliferate, resulting in well-balanced reconstitution of donor T-cell subsets. In conclusion, the influence of PD-1 blockade differed within T-cell subsets and caused unbalanced reconstitution of T-cell subsets, resulting in severe GVHD. PTCy successfully restored T-cell homeostasis and ameliorated GVHD induced by PD-1-/- donor T cells. These findings may help explain the pathophysiology behind the observation that PTCy may mitigate the incidence and impact of GVHD associated with prior exposure to PD-1 blockade.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Shuntaro Ikegawa, Yusuke Meguri, Takumi Kondo, Hiroyuki Sugiura, Yasuhisa Sando, Makoto Nakamura, Miki Iwamoto, Yoshinobu Maeda, Ken-Ichi Matsuoka<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.4<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31821459">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Effect of ketotifen fumarate on experimental autoimmune orchitis and torsion of the spermatic cord.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The aim of this work was to study effects of ketotifen fumarate (KF) on prevention of tissue damage in testes of rats with experimental autoimmune orchitis (EAO) and on the contralateral testis in a model of prolonged testicular cord torsion (TCT). Rats with EAO or TCT were injected intraperitoneally once daily with KF or saline solution (vehicle group). Incidence and severity of testicular damage were evaluated by histopathology using an EAO score or a Johnsen score. Mast cells (MC) were identified by histochemistry and quantified. In EAO model, KF significantly reduced severity of histopathological testicular damage compared to rats in the vehicle group. KF also reduced the number of testicular MC compared to vehicle group. Similarly, in TCT model, multifocal damage of the contralateral testis was observed 30 days after testicular torsion characterized by sloughing of the germinal epithelium, seminiferous tubule atrophy, and interstitial edema. Focal signs of inflammation and fibrosis of seminiferous tubular walls were also observed. In contrast, sections of contralateral testis of rats injected with KF and killed 30 days after surgery showed normal histological features. A significant decrease in the number of MC was observed in rats treated with KF compared to untreated animals. In conclusion, we demonstrated that treatment with KF reduced testicular inflammatory process and MC infiltrates in both EAO and TCT models.

TLRs are instrumental in activating inflammatory responses in innate immune cells, but their function in adaptive immune cells is less well understood. Here we show that synthetic ligands of TLR8 boosted T cell receptor signaling, resulting in increased cytokine production and upregulation of surface activation markers. Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation, but not TLR7 or TLR9, further promoted T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 and Th17. In addition, we found that endosomal HIV induced cytokine secretion from CD4+ T cells in a TLR8-specific manner. TLR8 engagement also enhanced HIV-1 replication and potentiated the reversal of latency in patient-derived T cells. The adjuvant TLR8 activity in T cells can contribute to viral dissemination in the lymph node and low-grade inflammation in HIV patients.

The normal conjunctiva epithelium and sub-epithelial stroma contains resident immune cells, such as T cells, B cells (adaptive), dendritic cells, and macrophages (innate). The relative sterile environment of the cornea is achieved by the tolerogenic properties of dendritic cells in the conjunctiva, the presence of regulatory lymphocytes, and the existence of soluble immunosuppressive factors, such as the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and macrophage migration inhibitory factors. With the presence of both innate and adaptive immune system components, it is intriguing to investigate the most important leukocyte population in the ocular surface, which is involved in immune surveillance. Our meta-analysis investigates into this with a focus on both infectious (contact lens wear, corneal graft rejection, Cytomegalovirus, keratitis, scleritis, ocular surgery) and non-infectious (dry eye disease, glaucoma, graft-vs-host disease, Sjögren's syndrome) situations. We have found the predominance of dendritic cells in ocular surface diseases, along with the Th-related cytokines. Our goal is to improve the knowledge of immune cells in OSID and to open new dimensions in the field. The purpose of this study is not to limit ourselves in the ocular system, but to investigate the importance of dendritic cells in the disorders of other mucosal organs (e.g., lungs, gut, uterus). Holistically, we want to investigate if this is a common trend in the initiation of any disease related to the mucosal organs and find a unified therapeutic approach. In addition, we want to show the power of computational approaches to foster a collaboration between computational and biological science.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-07<br><b>Authors:</b> Amaya Pérez Del Palomar, Alberto Montolío, José Cegoñino, Sandeep Kumar Dhanda, Chit Tong Lio, Tanima Bose<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.34<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31810226">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hippo Pathway and YAP Signaling Alterations in Squamous Cancer of the Head and Neck.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Head and neck cancer affects the upper aerodigestive tract and is the sixth leading cancer worldwide by incidence and the seventh by cause of death. Despite significant advances in surgery and chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapeutic options for this type of cancer are scarce and long term survival rates remain low. Recently, comprehensive genomic studies have highlighted the most commonly altered genes and signaling pathways in this cancer. The Hippo-YAP pathway has been identified as a key oncogenic pathway in multiple tumors. Expression of genes controlled by the Hippo downstream transcriptional coactivators YAP (Yes-associated protein 1) and TAZ (WWTR1, WW domain containing transcription regulator 1) is widely deregulated in human cancer including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Interestingly, YAP/TAZ signaling might not be as essential for the normal homeostasis of adult tissues as for oncogenic growth, altogether making the pathway an amenable therapeutic target in cancer. Recent advances in the role of Hippo-YAP pathway in HNSCC have provided evidence that genetic alterations frequent in this type of cancer such as <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Karla Santos-de-Frutos, Carmen Segrelles, Corina Lorz<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.34<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817001">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Stromal cells from perinatal and adult sources modulate the inflammatory immune response in vitro by decreasing Th1 cell proliferation and cytokine secretion.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Many immune-mediated conditions are associated with a dysregulated imbalance toward a Th1 response leading to disease onset, severity, and damage. Many of the therapies such as immunomodulators or anti-TNF-α antibodies often fall short in preventing disease progression and ameliorating disease conditions. Thus, new therapies that can target inflammatory environments would have a major impact in preventing the progression of inflammatory diseases. We investigated the role of human stromal cells derived from the amniotic fluid (AFSCs), the placenta (PLSCs), and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in modulating the inflammatory response of in vitro-stimulated circulating blood-derived immune cells. Immune cells were isolated from the blood of healthy individuals and stimulated in vitro with antigens to activate inflammatory responses to stimuli. AFSC, BM-MSCs, and PLSCs were cocultured with stimulated leukocytes, neutrophils, or lymphocytes. Inflammatory cytokine production, neutrophil migration, enzymatic degranulation, T cell proliferation, and subsets were evaluated. Coculture of all three stromal cell types decreased the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes such as IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, neutrophil elastase, and the transcription factor NF-κB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes. With isolated phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cells coculture leads to a decrease in lymphocyte proliferation. This effect correlated with decreased numbers of Th1 lymphocytes and decreased secreted levels of IFN-γ.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Oula Khoury, Anthony Atala, Sean V Murphy<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cells Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2157-6580<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.34<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.98<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.145<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638323">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> C3a-C3aR signaling promotes breast cancer lung metastasis via modulating carcinoma associated fibroblasts.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests that complement components promote tumor progression via modulating immune suppression, angiogenesis, or tumor cell proliferation.

METHODS: We performed various ex-vivo and in-vivo assays. Genetic and pharmacological C3aR blockade models were applied to investigate the role of C3a-C3aR in metastasis of breast cancer.
RESULTS: C3a-C3aR signaling in CAFs facilitates the metastasis of breast cancer. Mechanically, C3a-C3aR signaling augments pro-metastatic cytokine secretion and extracellular matrix components expression of CAFs via the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of C3aR signaling effectively inhibited lung metastasis of breast cancer in mouse models.

Recent studies have revealed that galectin-9 regulates cellular biological reactions and plays a pivotal role in fibrosis. The aim of this study was to determine the role of galectin-9 in the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced systemic sclerosis (SSc).
METHODS: Human galectin-9 levels in the serum of patients with SSc and mouse sera galectin-9 levels were measured by a Bio-Plex immunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung fibrosis was induced using bleomycin in galectin-9 wild-type and knockout mice. The effects of galectin-9 on the fibrosis markers and signaling molecules in the mouse lung tissues and primary lung fibroblast cells were assessed with western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Galectin-9 levels in the serum were significantly higher (9-fold) in patients compared to those of healthy individuals. Galectin-9 deficiency in mice prominently ameliorated epithelial proliferation, collagen I accumulation, and α-smooth muscle actin expression. In addition, the galectin-9 knockout mice showed reduced protein expression levels of fibrosis markers such as Smad2/3, connective tissue growth factor, and endothelin-1. Differences between the wild-type and knockout groups were also observed in the AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways. Galectin-9 deficiency decreased the signal activation induced by transforming growth factor-beta in mouse primary fibroblasts, which plays a critical role in fibroblast activation and aberrant catabolism of the extracellular matrix.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that lack of galectin-9 protects against bleomycin-induced SSc. Moreover, galectin-9 might be involved in regulating the progression of fibrosis in multiple pathways.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Yu-An Hsu, Ching-Yao Chang, Joung-Liang Lan, Ju-Pi Li, Hui-Ju Lin, Chih-Sheng Chen, Lei Wan, Fu-Tong Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

Previous studies have revealed that host immune reaction to allogeneic transplants could be regulated by thymus transplantation. However, physiological thymus involution hinders the clinical application of these insights. Here, we report an efficient generation of thymic epithelial-like tissue derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and its potential to regulate immune reaction in allogeneic transplantation. We established an iPSC line which constitutively expresses mouse Foxn1 gene and examined the effect of its expression during in vitro differentiation of thymic epithelial cells (TECs). We found that Foxn1 expression enhances the differentiation induction of cells expressing TEC-related cell surface molecules along with upregulation of endogenous Foxn1. iPSC-derived TECs (iPSC-TECs) generated T cells in nude recipient mice after renal subcapsular transplantation.

In parallel, studies on the role of intracellular DNA sensors in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been conducted, including the one using a mouse model lacking one of the sensors. These and other data have established a framework for understanding the pathogenic role of anti-DNA antibodies, but studies on normal cells are limited. Here, we used the monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibody 2C10, 2-kbp dsDNA and healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to test whether and how 2C10 and/or DNA cause pathology in normal cells. We found that on culture with PBMCs, 2C10 preferentially entered monocytes and that DNA enhanced this internalization. In contrast, DNA alone was not significantly internalized by monocytes, but 2C10 facilitated its internalization. This was suppressed by cytochalasin D, but not by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, chloroquine or an Fc blocker, suggesting the involvement of macropinocytosis in this process. Internalization of 2C10 and DNA together resulted in production of interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-33 by PBMCs. Cytokine production was suppressed by chloroquine and shikonin, but not by RU.521, suggesting dependence on activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM-2) pathways. These results established a simple model to demonstrate that anti-DNA antibodies can cause dysregulation of cytokine network mimicking systemic lupus erythematosus in culture of normal PBMCs, and emphasize again the importance of maintaining anti-DNA antibodies at low levels by treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-11<br><b>Authors:</b> K Inoue, M Ishizawa, T Kubota<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin.

About two third of patients with CRC will develop distant recurrence at some point in time. Liver is the most common site where distant metastasis takes place. While the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic CRC was poor about 3 decades ago, there has been tremendous improvement in this area in the recent years. With the advent of effective systemic chemotherapy and biologic agents and better understanding of the biological behaviour of the tumour, aggressive treatment strategies such as metastatectomy of the liver metastases (or lung metastases) are now acceptable. More importantly, it has transformed the way how stage IV CRCs are being managed. From predominantly palliative as the primary aim, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach is now the mainstay of treatment with very successful outcomes. Combination of systemic therapies with liver resection has been shown to be effective in providing promising survival benefits. In addition, other adjunctive modalities in targeting the liver metastases such as ablation, combining resection and ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), hepatic artery perfusion, etc. have also been demonstrated variable outcome in treating colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). Very recently, transplant oncologists have also explored using liver transplantation as a treatment modality for unresectable CRLM, which has demonstrated very good long-term survival in well selected cases.

However, expression of PD-L1 protein in colon cancer and its significance in clinical prognosis are yet to be fully clarified. This study examined the relationship between PD-L1 expression with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of colon cancer.
METHODS: This study collected cases of primary colon cancer that had not undergone preoperative chemotherapy and had complete clinical data. Eighty specimens each were obtained from cancer tissues, paracancer tissues, and normal tissues. Immunohistochemical assays were performed to detect PD-L1 expression.

In our study, we investigated whether Interleukin-10 (IL-10) treatment delays and prevents the development of aneurysms, and the molecular mechanism whereby IL-10 could inhibit proliferation of VSMC by inhibiting inflammatory responses in abdominal aortic aneurysms.
METHODS: Models of rabbit abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) were established by elastin pressurization and perfusion, and recombinant IL-10 was used as a drug to intervene in treatment of the AAA model by rabbit ear vein injection. 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after establishing the AAA model, color Doppler ultrasound and H&E staining was used to observe the development of AAA. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to detect the gene expression of PCNA, OPN and α-SMA, Th1/Th2 cytokines were detected by RT-qPCR, Nf-kB and MCP-1 protein was analyzed by immunochemistry. Activation of Macrophage was analyzed by immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Compared with the model group without any intervention, after treatment with IL-10, a decreased cell number was recorded and number of layers of smooth muscle cells in rabbit abdominal aortic aneurysms were significantly reduced, as was elastin breakage and smooth muscle cell degradation. The gene expression of PCNA and OPN, the mRNA expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and the protein expression of NF-kB and MCP-1 were elevated (P < 0.05), but α-SMA, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-13 were decreased (P < 0.05) in abdominal aortic aneurysm. The M2/M1 macrophage ratio increased significantly.
CONCLUSION: With treatment by IL-10, the development of rabbit abdominal aortic aneurysm was delayed. The molecular mechanism may have been that IL-10 treatment inhibits inflammation in aneurysm tissue by promoting the activation of M2 macrophages and altering Th1/Th2 cytokine production.Tthe inhibited inflammatory response promoted the proliferation and phenotypic transformation of VSMC.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Huanlei Zhu, Xueqin Qu, Cuisheng Zhang, Ying Yu<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Clin Exp Pathol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1936-2625<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.34<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.19<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.393<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31933940">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Attenuation of TCR-induced transcription by Bach2 controls regulatory T cell differentiation and homeostasis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Differentiation and homeostasis of Foxp3<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Tom Sidwell, Yang Liao, Alexandra L Garnham, Ajithkumar Vasanthakumar, Renee Gloury, Jonas Blume, Peggy P Teh, David Chisanga, Christoph Thelemann, Fabian de Labastida Rivera, Christian R Engwerda, Lynn Corcoran, Kohei Kometani, Tomohiro Kurosaki, Gordon K Smyth, Wei Shi, Axel Kallies<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937752">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Integrated single cell analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes in multiple sclerosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protects the central nervous system (CNS) and analyzing CSF aids the diagnosis of CNS diseases, but our understanding of CSF leukocytes remains superficial.

Mounting evidence has highlighted circRNAs as critical regulators of various tumours. More importantly, circRNAs have been revealed to recruit and reprogram key components involved in the tumour microenvironment (TME), and mediate various signaling pathways, thus affecting tumourigenesis, angiogenesis, immune response, and metastatic progression. In this review, we briefly introduce the biogenesis, characteristics and classification of circRNAs, and describe various mechanistic models of circRNAs. Further, we provide the first systematic overview of the interplay between circRNAs and cellular/non-cellular counterparts of the TME and highlight the potential of circRNAs as prospective biomarkers or targets in cancer clinics. Finally, we discuss the biological mechanisms through which the circRNAs drive development of resistance, revealing the mystery of circRNAs in drug resistance of tumours.
SHORT CONCLUSION: Deep understanding the emerging role of circRNAs and their involvements in the TME may provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer patients. The combined targeting of circRNAs and co-activated components in the TME may achieve higher therapeutic efficiency and become a new mode of tumour therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghua Ma, You Shuai, Xiangyu Gao, Xianzi Wen, Jiafu Ji<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

Current strategies for tolerance induction mainly focus on inhibiting alloreactive T cells while promoting regulatory immune cells. Pathogenic infections may have direct impact on both effector and regulatory cell populations, therefore can alter host susceptibility to transplantation tolerance induction as well as impair the quality and stability of tolerance once induced. In this review, we will discuss existing data demonstrating the effect of infections on transplantation tolerance, with particular emphasis on the role of the stage of infection (acute, chronic, or latent) and the stage of tolerance (induction or maintenance) in this infection-tolerance interaction. While the deleterious effect of acute infection on tolerance is mainly driven by proinflammatory cytokines induced shortly after the infection, chronic infection may generate exhausted T cells that could in fact facilitate transplantation tolerance. In addition to pathogenic infections, commensal intestinal microbiota also has numerous significant immunomodulatory effects that can shape the host alloimmunity following transplantation. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies for robustly inducing and stably maintaining transplantation tolerance while preserving host anti-pathogen immunity in clinically relevant scenarios.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Shuangjin Yu, Chang Su, Xunrong Luo<br><b>Journal:</b> Immunol.

The aim of the study was to characterize T-cell populations within tumor tissue and compare them with non-neoplastic liver tissue as well as circulating cells of the same patients.
METHODS: The presence of unique cell populations was investigated in 36 HCC patients by multidimensional flow cytometry followed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis. Functional activity of tumor-infiltrating T cells was determined after activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin.
RESULTS: Within the tumor there were more cells expressing CD137 and ICOS than in non-neoplastic liver tissue, possibly after recent antigenic activation. These cells contained several populations, including the following: (1) functionally impaired, proliferating CD4
CONCLUSIONS: Unique populations of activated T cells are present in HCC tissue, whose antigen specificity remains to be investigated. Some of these cell populations are functionally impaired and nivolumab treatment restores their responsiveness. The finding of ongoing immune response within the tumor shows which lymphocyte populations are impaired within the HCC and identifies the patients who might take benefit from immunotherapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Daniela Di Blasi, Tujana Boldanova, Lucia Mori, Luigi Terracciano, Markus H Heim, Gennaro De Libero<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2352-345X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.85<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.138<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445190">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Influence of Dietary Fatty Acids on Immune Responses.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Diet-derived fatty acids (FAs) are essential sources of energy and fundamental structural components of cells.

A prime event of this altered metabolism is increased glucose uptake and discharge of lactate into the cells surrounding constructing a favorable tumor niche. Several oncogenic factors help in promoting this consequence including, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis in tumor metabolism via exhibiting its low pyruvate kinase activity and nuclear moon-lightening functions to increase the synthesis of lactate and macromolecules for tumor proliferation. Not only its role in cancer cells but also its role in the tumor microenvironment cells has to be understood for developing the small molecules against it which is lacking with the literature till date. Therefore, in this present review, the role of PKM2 with respect to various tumor niche cells will be clarified. Further, it highlights the updated list of therapeutics targeting PKM2 pre-clinically and clinically with their added limitations.

These therapies, that take the tumor-induced immunosuppressive microenvironment into account, target the tumor immune escape, in particular the inhibitory receptors involved in the regulation of the effector T cells' activity (immune checkpoints). The aim of this study was to identify, in ECs, differences in intergrades immune status that could contribute to the differences in tumor aggressiveness, and could also be used as theranostic tools. The immune status of tumors was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. We analyzed the expression of specific genes associated to specific leukocytes subpopulations and the expression of reporting genes associated with the tumor escape/resistance. This study highlights significant differences in the EC intergrades immune status especially the tumor-infiltrating cell types and their activation status as well as in the molecular factors produced by the environment. The immune microenvironment of grade 1 ECs hints at a robust tumoricidal milieu while that of higher grades is more evocative of a tolerogenic milieu. This genes-based immunological monitoring of tumors that easily highlights significant intergrade differences relating to the density, composition and functional state of the leukocyte infiltrate, could give solid arguments for choosing the best therapeutic options, especially those targeting immune checkpoints. Moreover it could enable an easy adaptation of individual treatment approaches for each patient.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Julie Antomarchi, Damien Ambrosetti, Charlotte Cohen, Jérôme Delotte, Anne Chevallier, Babou Karimdjee-Soilihi, Mélanie Ngo-Mai, Annie Schmid-Alliana, Heidy Schmid-Antomarchi<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancer Microenviron<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1875-2292<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.00<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.759<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134527">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Current understandings of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes: Genetics to environment.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that usually strikes early in life, but can affect individuals at almost any age. It is caused by autoreactive T cells that destroy insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Epidemiological studies estimate a prevalence of 1 in 300 children in the United States with an increasing incidence of 2%-5% annually worldwide. The daily responsibility, clinical management, and vigilance required to maintain blood sugar levels within normal range and avoid acute complications (hypoglycemic episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis) and long term micro- and macro-vascular complications significantly affects quality of life and public health care costs. Given the expansive impact of T1D, research work has accelerated and T1D has been intensively investigated with the focus to better understand, manage and cure this condition. Many advances have been made in the past decades in this regard, but key questions remain as to why certain people develop T1D, but not others, with the glaring example of discordant disease incidence among monozygotic twins. In this review, we discuss the field's current understanding of its pathophysiology and the role of genetics and environment on the development of T1D. We examine the potential implications of these findings with an emphasis on T1D inheritance patterns, twin studies, and disease prevention. Through a better understanding of this process, interventions can be developed to prevent or halt it at early stages.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Adebola Matthew Giwa, Rizwan Ahmed, Zahra Omidian, Neha Majety, Kagan Ege Karakus, Sarah M Omer, Thomas Donner, Abdel Rahim A Hamad<br><b>Journal:</b> World J Diabetes<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1948-9358<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.00<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.421<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31938470">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Benefits of hesperidin in central nervous system disorders: a review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Citrus species contain significant amounts of flavonoids that possess antioxidant activities; furthermore, dietary citrus is not associated with adverse effects or cytotoxicity in healthy individuals. Hesperidin, which is an abundant flavanone glycoside in the peel of citrus fruits, possesses a variety of biological capabilities that include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. Over the last few decades, many studies have been investigated the biological actions of hesperidin and its aglycone, hesperetin, as well as their underlying mechanisms. Due to the antioxidant effects of hesperidin and its derivatives, the cardioprotective and anti-cancer effects of these compounds have been widely reviewed. Although the biological activities of hesperidin in neurodegenerative diseases have been evaluated, its potential involvement in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including autoimmune demyelinating disease, requires further investigation in terms of the underlying mechanisms. Thus, the present review will focus on the potential role of hesperidin in diverse models of CNS neuroinflammation, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, with special consideration given to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in neurodegenerative disease models.

Among them, ICIs are the most commonly used and intensively studied. Since 2011, these drugs have received marketing authorisation for melanoma, lung, bladder, renal, and head and neck cancers, with remarkable and long-lasting treatment response in some patients. The novel mechanism of action of ICIs, with immune and T cell activation, leads to unusual patterns of response on imaging, with the advent of so-called pseudoprogression being more pronounced and frequently observed when compared to other anticancer therapies. Pseudoprogression, described in about 2-10% of patients treated with ICIs, corresponds to an increase of tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions due to infiltration by activated T cells before the disease responds to therapy. To overcome the limitation of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) to assess these specific changes, new imaging criteria-so-called immune-related response criteria and then immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)-were proposed. The major modification involved the inclusion of the measurements of new target lesions into disease assessments and the need for a 4-week re-assessment to confirm or not confirm progression. The RECIST working group introduced the new concept of "unconfirmed progression", into the irRECIST. This paper reviews current immunotherapeutic approaches and summarises radiologic criteria to evaluate new patterns of response to immunotherapy.

Disturbances in cytokines are considered to be associated with hepatitis Flares. There are limited data on cytokines changes in HBeAg positive patients with ALT abnormalities.This is an observational study. Pregnant patients with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) positive were enrolled from January 2014 to September 2018. Patients were assigned into three groups based on ALT levels in postpartum 6 to 8 weeks: ALT in normal range, ALT in 1 to 2-fold upper limits of normal (ULN) and ALT >2-fold ULN. Serum cytokines, ratios of regulatory T cells, and the concentration of cortisol were collected and compared among the three groups.Of the 135 mothers enrolled, 80.7% (109/135) completed the postpartum 6-week study. 13.8% (15/109) patients had postpartum ALT higher than 2ULN, 27.5% (30/109) patients had ALT in 1 to 2ULN and 58.7% (64/109) patients had ALT in normal range. Compared to control group, patients with ALT >2ULN had a higher IL-10 level (P < .05). No differences of IL-10 levels were found in the comparison of other inter comparison among three groups. No differences were found in the levels of other collected serum cytokines, cortisol, and regulatory T cells among three groups. On multivariate analysis, abnormal IL-10 level was independent risk factor for postpartum ALT elevating >2ULN. At the same time, the incidence of postpartum ALT elevated >2ULN were higher in patients with abnormal elevation IL-10 level than in patients with normal IL-10 level (14/68 vs 1/41, P = .008).CHB patients with postpartum ALT abnormalities show higher IL-10 level and postpartum ALT abnormalities were mainly occurred in patients with abnormal IL-10 level.

We hypothesized that eating during or around physiologic rest time, a common habit in modern society, causes CRD and investigated the mechanisms by which it promotes alcohol-associated colon carcinogenesis.
METHODS: The effect of feeding time on CRD was assessed using B6 mice expressing a fusion protein of PERIOD2 and LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) were used to model colon polyposis and to assess the effects of feeding schedules, alcohol consumption, and prebiotic treatment on microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acid levels, colon inflammation, and cancer risk. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was assessed by inactivating the butyrate receptor GPR109A.
RESULTS: Eating at rest (wrong-time eating [WTE]) shifted the phase of the colon rhythm in PER2::LUC mice. In TS4Cre × APC

Here, using a murine thymic slice model in which thymocytes undergo negative selection in situ, we demonstrate that phagocytosis promotes negative selection, and provide evidence for the escape of autoreactive CD8 T cells to the periphery when phagocytosis in the thymus is impaired. We also show that negative selection is more efficient when the phagocyte also presents the negative selecting peptide. Our findings support a model for negative selection in which the death process initiated following strong TCR signaling is facilitated by phagocytosis.

Fundamental advances in our understanding of MSCs and EVs have allowed these fields to merge and create potential cell-free therapy options that are cell-based. EVs contain active cargo including proteins, microRNA, and mRNA species that can impact signaling responses in target cells to modify inflammatory and repair responses. Increasing numbers of preclinical studies in animals with various types of injury models have been published that demonstrate the potential impact of MSC-EV therapy. Although the emergence of registered clinical protocols suggests translation to clinical application has already begun, several barriers to more widespread clinical adoption remain. In this review, we highlight the progress made in MSC-derived small EV-based therapy by summarizing aspects pertaining to the starting material for MSC expansion, EV production, and isolation methods, studies from preclinical models that have established a foundation of knowledge to support translation into the patient setting, and potential barriers to overcome on the path to clinical application.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-14<br><b>Authors:</b> David Allan, Alvin Tieu, Manoj Lalu, Dylan Burger<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cells Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2157-6580<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.23<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.98<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.145<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411820">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Piperlongumine regulates epigenetic modulation and alleviates psoriasis-like skin inflammation via inhibition of hyperproliferation and inflammation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease, where chronic immune responses due to exaggerated cytokine signaling, abnormal differentiation, and evasion of keratinocytes apoptosis plays a crucial role in mediating abnormal keratinocytes hyperproliferation. From the therapeutic perspective, the molecules with strong anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties could have tremendous relevance. In this study, we demonstrated that piperlongumine (PPL) treatment effectively abrogated the hyperproliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes by inducing ROS-mediated late apoptosis with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Besides, the arrest of cell cycle was found at Sub-G1 phase as a result of DNA fragmentation. Molecularly, inhibition of STAT3 and Akt signaling was observed with a decrease in proliferative markers such as PCNA, ki67, and Cyclin D1 along with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Keratin 17 is a critical regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, and it was found to be downregulated with PPL significantly. Furthermore, prominent anti-inflammatory effects were observed by inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced p65 NF-κB signaling cascade and strongly inhibited the production of cytokine storm involved in psoriasis-like skin inflammation, thus led to the restoration of normal epidermal architecture with reduction of epidermal hyperplasia and splenomegaly. In addition, PPL epigenetically inhibited histone-modifying enzymes, which include histone deacetylases (HDACs) of class I (HDAC1-4) and class II (HDAC6) evaluated by immunoblotting and HDAC enzyme assay kit. In addition, our results show that PPL effectively inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65 and a histone modulator HDAC3, thus sequestered in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Furthermore, PPL effectively enhanced the protein-protein interactions of HDAC3 and p65 with IκBα, which was disrupted by LPS stimulation and were evaluated by Co-IP and molecular modeling. Collectively, our findings indicate that piperlongumine may serve as an anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory agent and could serve as a potential therapeutic option in treating psoriasis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Sowjanya Thatikonda, Venkatesh Pooladanda, Dilep Kumar Sigalapalli, Chandraiah Godugu<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Death Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-4889<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.23<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.310<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31924750">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Aberrant DNA methylation profile exacerbates inflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis patients.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterised by incoordination, sensory loss, weakness, changes in bladder capacity and bowel function, fatigue and cognitive impairment, creating a significant socioeconomic burden. The pathogenesis of MS involves both genetic susceptibility and exposure to distinct environmental risk factors. The gene x environment interaction is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics refers to a complex system that modifies gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The most studied epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation. This epigenetic mark participates in distinct MS pathophysiological processes, including blood-brain barrier breakdown, inflammatory response, demyelination, remyelination failure and neurodegeneration. In this study, we also accurately summarised a list of environmental factors involved in the MS pathogenesis and its clinical course.

Dysfunction in these neuromodulatory mechanisms compromised by SAE jeopardizes systemic immune responses, including those of neutrophils, macrophages/monocytes, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes, which ultimately results in a vicious cycle between brain injury and a progressively aberrant immune response.

In our cohort, we analysed transcriptional networks of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to identify central regulators and potential biomarkers. We investigated the mRNA- and miRNA-transcriptome of PBMCs of healthy subjects and patients suffering from CAP or AECOPD by microarray and Taqman Low Density Array. Genes that correlated with PBMC composition were eliminated, and remaining differentially expressed genes were grouped into modules. One selected module (120 genes) was particularly suitable to discriminate AECOPD and CAP and most notably contained a subset of five biologically relevant mRNAs that differentiated between CAP and AECOPD with an AUC of 86.1%. Likewise, we identified several microRNAs, e.g. miR-545-3p and miR-519c-3p, which separated AECOPD and CAP. We furthermore retrieved an integrated network of differentially regulated mRNAs and microRNAs and identified HNF4A, MCC and MUC1 as central network regulators or most important discriminatory markers.

RSPOs induce the turnover of negative Wnt regulators RNF43 and ZNRF3 through a process that requires RSPO interactions with Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs), or through an LGR-independent mechanism that is enhanced by RSPO binding to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Here, we describe the engineering of 'surrogate RSPOs' that function independently of LGRs to potentiate Wnt signaling on cell types expressing a target surface marker. These bispecific proteins were generated by fusing an RNF43- or ZNRF3-specific single chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) to the immune cytokine IL-2. Surrogate RSPOs mimic the function of natural RSPOs by crosslinking the extracellular domain (ECD) of RNF43 or ZNRF3 to the ECD of the IL-2 receptor CD25, which sequesters the complex and results in highly selective amplification of Wnt signaling on CD25+ cells. Furthermore, surrogate RSPOs were able substitute for wild type RSPO in a colon organoid growth assay when intestinal stem cells were transduced to express CD25.

The aim of this study was to clarify immune-mediated mechanisms of coexisting HT, which might influence PTC progression. 30 patients with histologically confirmed conventional-type PTC and 30 patients with PTC and coexisting HT were enrolled in the study. To analyze the role of immune-mediated links between PTC and HT, immunohistochemical investigation was conducted to count the number of different immune cells including T-cytotoxic cells (CD8), plasma cells (CD138), Treg cells (FOXP3), mast cells (MCT), and M2 macrophages (CD163). It was shown that despite the high number of immune cells in the intact thyroid tissues of PTC patients with coexisting HT there were no significant differences in M2 macrophages, mast cells and Treg counts inside PTC with or without HT. PTC with HT was associated with a higher number of CD8+ cells (P < 0.001) reflecting the ability of immune system to generate and recruit T-cytotoxic cells in tumor area, which can explain the protective effect of HT on PTC progression. Lymph node metastases development was associated with an increased number of mast cells, M2 macrophages and Treg along with a decreased plasma cells count regardless of coexisting HT.

The immune response to sepsis is dependent on the innate and adaptive immune systems. The first line is the innate system, which requires complex and multiple pathways in order to eliminate the invading threats. The adaptive responses start after the innate response. The cell-mediated arm of CD4+ and CD8+ T and B cells is the main responsible for this response. A coordinated cytokine response is essential for the host immune response. A dysregulated response can lead to a hyperinflammatory condition (cytokine storm). This hyperinflammation leads to neutrophils activation and may also lead to organ dysfunction. An imbalance of this response can increase the anti-inflammatory response, leading to compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS), persistent inflammation-immunsupression, catabolism syndrome (PICS), and, above all, an immune paralysis stat.

Although some evidence links SCFAs with host metabolic health via several biological mechanisms, the role of SCFA on CV disease in patients with kidney disease remains unclear. Herein, we investigate the association between a SCFA, 2-methylbutyric acid, and target CV proteomics to explore the potential pathophysiology of SCFA-related CV benefit in patients with kidney disease. Circulating 2-methylbutyric acid was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and 181 CV proteins by a proximity extension assay in 163 patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The associations between 2-methylbutyric acid and CV proteins were evaluated using linear regression analysis with age and gender, and multiple testing adjustment. The selected CV protein in the discovery phase was further confirmed in multivariable-adjusted models and evaluated by continuous scale association. The mean value of circulating 2-methylbutyric acid was 0.22 ± 0.02 µM, which was negatively associated with bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) according to the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing adjustment method.

Despite the remarkable improvements achieved in immunosuppression strategies after the publication of the Edmonton protocol, long-term data of intra-hepatic islet transplantation show a gradual decline in beta-cell function. Therefore, there is a growing interest in the investigation of novel, safe and effective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory strategies able to promote long-term islet graft survival and notable improvements in clinical outcomes of islet transplant recipients. Vitamin D has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Pre-clinical studies investigating the use of vitamin D and its analogs (alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents and/or other anti-inflammatory agents, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) showed beneficial results in terms of islet graft survival and prevention of recurrence of autoimmunity/allograft rejection in animal models of syngeneic and allogeneic islet transplantation. Moreover, epidemiologic studies demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent after solid organ transplantation (e.g., heart, liver or kidney transplantation). However, studies that critically assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among islet transplant recipients have yet to be conducted. In addition, prospective studies aimed to address the safety and efficacy of vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant immunomodulatory strategy in islet transplant recipients are lacking and are therefore awaited in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Marco Infante, Camillo Ricordi, Nathalia Padilla, Ana Alvarez, Elina Linetsky, Giacomo Lanzoni, Alessandro Mattina, Federico Bertuzzi, Andrea Fabbri, David Baidal, Rodolfo Alejandro<br><b>Journal:</b> Nutrients<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6643<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.17<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.493<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816979">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Human Postprandial Nutrient Metabolism and Low-Grade Inflammation: A Narrative Review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The importance of the postprandial state has been acknowledged, since hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are linked with several chronic systemic low-grade inflammation conditions.

The arachidonic acid cytochrome P-450 (CYP) pathway has thus far received relatively little attention in its relation to asthma. In this study, we studied the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) on airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in a chronic asthmatic model which long-term exposure to antigen over a period of 12 weeks. The expression of sEH and CYP2J2, the level of 14, 15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), airway remodeling, hyperresponsiveness and inflammation were analyzed to determine the inhibition of sEH. The intragastric administration of 3 or 10 mg/kg ZDHXB-101, which is a structural derivative of natural product honokiol and a novel soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor, daily for 9 weeks significantly increased the level of 14, 15-EETs by inhibiting the expression of sEH and increasing the expression of CYP2J2 in lung tissues. ZDHXB-101 reduced the expression of remodeling-related markers such as interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17, MMP-9 N-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin, S100A4, Twist, goblet cell metaplasia, and collagen deposition in the lung tissue or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Moreover, ZDHXB-101 alleviated AHR, which is an indicator that is used to evaluate the airway remodeling function. The inhibitory effects of ZDHXB-101 were demonstrated to be related to its direct inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, as well as inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signal transduction.

FoxO3α, a member of the forkhead box O family of transcription factors, plays an important role in DN by regulating oxidative stress. The activity of FoxO3α is related to its phosphorylation and acetylation status, regulated by Akt and Sirt1, a lysine deacetylase. Our study aimed to investigate whether fucoxanthin could alleviate oxidative stress and fibrosis via FoxO3α in DN and whether Akt and Sirt1 were involved. We found that in GMCs cultured in HG, fucoxanthin treatment significantly reduced the expression of FN and collagen IV, as well as reactive oxygen species generation, suggesting that fucoxanthin is beneficial to alleviate both fibrosis and oxidative stress in DN. In addition, we found that fucoxanthin decreased the phosphorylation and acetylation level of FoxO3α, reversed the protein level of FoxO3α inhibited by HG, and then promoted the nuclear transport of FoxO3α. Besides, fucoxanthin promoted the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase, a downstream target of FoxO3α. Furthermore, we found that fucoxanthin reversed the activation of Akt and inhibition of Sirt1. However, the enhancement of fucoxanthin in FoxO3α expression and nuclear transport was significantly decreased by pretreatment with Akt activator SC79 or Sirt1 inhibitor EX527. In summary, our study explored fucoxanthin alleviated oxidative stress and fibrosis induced by HG through Akt/Sirt1/FoxO3α signaling in GMCs, suggesting fucoxanthin is a potential therapeutic strategy for DN.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Guanyu Yang, Lin Jin, Dongxiao Zheng, Xiaoliang Tang, Junwei Yang, Lingxuan Fan, Xi Xie<br><b>Journal:</b> Mar Drugs<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1660-3397<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.17<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.81<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.855<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31842414">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Repeated Oral Administration of a KDEL-tagged Recombinant Cholera Toxin B Subunit Effectively Mitigates DSS Colitis Despite a Robust Immunogenic Response.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), a non-toxic homopentameric component of <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Joshua M Royal, Micaela A Reeves, Nobuyuki Matoba<br><b>Journal:</b> Toxins (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6651<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.17<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.76<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.029<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31756977">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Prognostic role of pretreatment blood lymphocyte count in patients with solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: To evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment lymphocyte counts with respect to clinical outcomes in patients with solid tumors.

Here, we provide intestinal flora changes of CKD patients undertook different hemodialysis therapy.
METHODS: From 2017 to 2019, a total of 166 patients from Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital were recruited and divided into four groups with 17 cases in healthy control group, 47 cases in CKD non-dialysis group, 49 cases in HD group, and 53 cases in PD group. Intestinal flora genome 16S rDNA sequencing and further bio-informatic analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Decreased diversity and altered communities of intestinal flora in PD patients, in which microbial diversity was positive correlated with the albumin level were observed. A total of 20 intestinal flora phyla were detected in 166 fecal samples, divided into 3 dominant intestinal types including Bacteroides-dominant gut type, Firmicutes-dominant type and Proteobacteria-dominant gut type. Further analyses found 198 genera, the abundance of 86 genera were significantly different. Butyrate-producing taxa as Faecalibacterium in genera level and Bifidobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae in family level were dominant genus in CT, CKD, and HD groups, while urease containing-, indole- and p-cresol-forming taxa as Escherichia in genera and Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae in family level was dominated genus in PD group. Number of differential expressed genes in KEGG enrichment pathways were significantly different in PD group in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, translation, and membrane transport.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest peritoneal dialysis therapy could result in reduced diversity and altered microbial communities, with reduced probiotic butyrate-producing taxa and increased urease containing-, indole- and p-cresol-forming taxa.

These antibodies, also known as "inhibitors", significantly increase morbidity within the hemophilia population and lower the quality of life for these patients. People with severe hemophilia A have an overall 25-40% lifetime risk of inhibitor development, compared to that of 5-15% lifetime risk in those with moderate/mild hemophilia A. The risk is lower in hemophilia B population (about 1-5%) and occurrence of inhibitors is almost only seen in patients with severe hemophilia B. The understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism leading to the development of inhibitors in patients with hemophilia has improved considerably over the last 2 decades. Identification of early biomarkers which predict inhibitor development in previously untreated patients with hemophilia will assist in risk identification and possible early intervention strategies.

Here, we evaluated the association of circulatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels with lipid profile, some nutrients, and total anti-oxidant capacity in elderly people who presented cardiovascular disease (CVD) with or without metabolic syndrome (MetS) and in healthy subjects.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional case-control study, 258 sera prepared from elderly people (144 healthy and 114 patient subjects) who participated in a community-based study, the Amirkola Health and Ageing Project (AHAP), were analyzed for IL-10, lipid profile, vitamin D, selenium (Se), antioxidant capacity, and MetS.
RESULTS: Compared to patients, the healthy subjects exhibited higher levels of circulatory IL-10 among individuals with detectable serum IL-10 (P = 0.036). However, this difference was not observed when total subjects from both groups were compared, since more than 90% of those people were IL-10-negative. Se, vitamin D, and antioxidant levels were similar in both groups. There was a negative association between IL-10 and body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.050) and an equivocal association with vitamin D levels, whereas the association between IL-10 and other indicated variables was not significant. Significant association was observed between MetS and CVD prevalence (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between Se and total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) (P < 0.010) in healthy subjects and with TC in patients (P < 0.050).
CONCLUSION: A major proportion of elderly people were serum IL-10-negative, whereas independently to IL-10, MetS was most common in patients with CVD.

Late-life chronic low-grade inflammation ("inflammaging") and altered signal transduction pathways in metabolism have been identified as two of the key themes in the aging process. Age-related changes in the immune and metabolic responses are also recognized as playing a critical pathogenic role in most common chronic medical conditions that plague the elderly. Emerging investigations emphasize the interconnectedness of the immune and metabolic responses in aging, an area of gerontological research that can be termed "meta-inflammaging."<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Guobing Chen, Raymond Yung<br><b>Journal:</b> Aging Med (Milton)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2475-0360<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.17<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31942529">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The <br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Junshang Ge, Jie Wang, Hui Wang, Xianjie Jiang, Qianjin Liao, Qian Gong, Yongzhen Mo, Xiaoling Li, Guiyuan Li, Wei Xiong, Jin Zhao, Zhaoyang Zeng<br><b>Journal:</b> J Cancer<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1837-9664<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.11<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.22<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.993<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949496">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> None<br><b>Abstract:</b> Genetic causes of male infertility that is associated with aging are largely unknown.

Unlimited numbers of markers may be unmixed from a limited-channel image, such as an RGB image, without adding any mathematical complicity to the model. Known co-localization information of different biomarkers within the same tissue section enables defining fixed upper bounds for the number of stains at one pixel. A group sparsity model may be leveraged to explicitly model the fractions of stain contributions from the co-localized biomarkers into one group to yield a least squares solution within the group. A sparse solution may be obtained among the groups to ensure that only a small number of groups with a total number of stains being less than the upper bound are activated.<br><b>Patent date:</b> January 21, 2020<br><b>File date:</b> August 22, 2016<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.27<br><b><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=(%22regulatory+T+cells%22+AND+(autoimmune+OR+cancer))&OS="regulatory+T+cells"+AND+(autoimmune+OR+cancer)&RS=("regulatory+T+cells"+AND+(autoimmune+OR+cancer))">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Galactoside inhibitor of galectins<br><b>Abstract:</b> An embodiment of the present invention relates to a compound of the general formula.
