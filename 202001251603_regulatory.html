Bulk and single-cell transcriptional profiling demonstrates that human migratory LCs are robustly programmed for MHC-I and MHC-II antigen presentation. Chromatin analysis reveals enrichment of ETS-IRF and AP1-IRF composite regulatory elements in antigen-presentation genes, coinciding with expression of the TFs, PU.1, IRF4 and BATF3 but not IRF8. Migration of LCs from the epidermis is accompanied by upregulation of IRF4, antigen processing components and co-stimulatory molecules. TNF stimulation augments LC cross-presentation while attenuating IRF4 expression. CRISPR-mediated editing reveals IRF4 to positively regulate the LC activation programme, but repress NF2EL2 and NF-kB pathway genes that promote responsiveness to oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. Thus, IRF4-dependent genomic programming of human migratory LCs appears to enable LC maturation while attenuating excessive inflammatory and immunogenic responses in the epidermis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Sofia Sirvent, Andres F Vallejo, James Davies, Kalum Clayton, Zhiguo Wu, Jeongmin Woo, Jeremy Riddell, Virendra K Chaudhri, Patrick Stumpf, Liliya Angelova Nazlamova, Gabrielle Wheway, Matthew Rose-Zerilli, Jonathan West, Mario Pujato, Xiaoting Chen, Christopher H Woelk, Ben MacArthur, Michael Ardern-Jones, Peter S Friedmann, Matthew T Weirauch, Harinder Singh, Marta E Polak<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949143">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Circular RNAs in the tumour microenvironment.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) widely expressed in eukaryotic cells. Mounting evidence has highlighted circRNAs as critical regulators of various tumours. More importantly, circRNAs have been revealed to recruit and reprogram key components involved in the tumour microenvironment (TME), and mediate various signaling pathways, thus affecting tumourigenesis, angiogenesis, immune response, and metastatic progression. In this review, we briefly introduce the biogenesis, characteristics and classification of circRNAs, and describe various mechanistic models of circRNAs. Further, we provide the first systematic overview of the interplay between circRNAs and cellular/non-cellular counterparts of the TME and highlight the potential of circRNAs as prospective biomarkers or targets in cancer clinics. Finally, we discuss the biological mechanisms through which the circRNAs drive development of resistance, revealing the mystery of circRNAs in drug resistance of tumours.
SHORT CONCLUSION: Deep understanding the emerging role of circRNAs and their involvements in the TME may provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer patients. The combined targeting of circRNAs and co-activated components in the TME may achieve higher therapeutic efficiency and become a new mode of tumour therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghua Ma, You Shuai, Xiangyu Gao, Xianzi Wen, Jiafu Ji<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

Multiplex profiling of primary GACs has been insightful but the underpinnings of PC's development/progression remain largely unknown. We characterised exome/transcriptome/immune landscapes of PC cells from patients with GAC aiming to identify novel therapeutic targets.
DESIGN: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on 44 PC specimens (43 patients with PC) including an integrative analysis of WES, RNA-seq, immune profile, clinical and pathological phenotypes to dissect the molecular pathogenesis, identifying actionable targets and/or biomarkers and comparison with TCGA primary GACs.

CONCLUSIONS: We have uncovered the unique mutational landscape, copy number alteration and gene expression profile of PC cells and defined PC molecular subtypes, which correlated with PC therapy resistance/response.

Therefore, we used F8-IL2, an antibody-IL2 fusion protein capable of selective localization to the tumor site, in combination with antibodies against murine CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1. In immunocompetent mice bearing CT26 tumors, the combination of F8-IL2 with CTLA-4 blockade was efficacious, leading to increased progression-free survival and protective immunity against subsequent tumor rechallenges. The combination with anti-PD-1 induced substantial tumor growth retardation, but tumor clearance was rare, whereas the combination with anti-PD-L1 exhibited the lowest activity. A detailed high-parametric single-cell analysis of the tumor leukocyte composition revealed that F8-IL2 had a strong impact on NK-cell activity without collateral immune activation in the systemic immune compartment, whereas CTLA-4 blockade led to significant changes in the T-cell compartment.

DESIGN: Systematic search was performed, FMT literature was critically appraised and a 1-day round-table discussion was conducted to derive expert consensus on key issues in FMT research.
RESULTS: 16 experts convened and discussed five questions regarding (1) the role of donor and recipient microbial (bacteria, viruses, fungi) parameters in FMT; (2) methods to assess microbiota alterations; (3) concept of keystone species and microbial predictors of FMT, (4) influence of recipient profile and antibiotics pretreatment on FMT engraftment and maintenance and (5) new developments in FMT formulations and delivery. The panel considered that variable outcomes of FMT relate to compositional and functional differences in recipient's microbiota, and likely donor-associated and recipient-associated physiological and genetic factors.
