The 3272-26A>G and 3849+10kbC>T CFTR mutations alter the correct splicing of the CFTR gene, generating new acceptor and donor splice sites respectively. Here we develop a genome editing approach to permanently correct these genetic defects, using a single crRNA and the Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6, AsCas12a. This genetic repair strategy is highly precise, showing very strong discrimination between the wild-type and mutant sequence and a complete absence of detectable off-targets. The efficacy of this gene correction strategy is verified in intestinal organoids and airway epithelial cells derived from CF patients carrying the 3272-26A>G or 3849+10kbC>T mutations, showing efficient repair and complete functional recovery of the CFTR channel. These results demonstrate that allele-specific genome editing with AsCas12a can correct aberrant CFTR splicing mutations, paving the way for a permanent splicing correction in genetic diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Giulia Maule, Antonio Casini, Claudia Montagna, Anabela S Ramalho, Kris De Boeck, Zeger Debyser, Marianne S Carlon, Gianluca Petris, Anna Cereseto<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 1.0<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.53<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391465">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gene therapy-emulating small molecule treatments in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells and patients.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Several small molecule corrector and potentiator drugs have recently been licensed for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) therapy. However, other aspects of the disease, especially inflammation, are less effectively treated by these drugs. We hypothesized that small molecule drugs could function either alone or as an adjuvant to licensed therapies to treat these aspects of the disease, perhaps emulating the effects of gene therapy in CF cells. The cardiac glycoside digitoxin, which has been shown to inhibit TNFα/NFκB signaling in CF lung epithelial cells, may serve as such a therapy.
METHODS: IB3-1 CF lung epithelial cells were treated with different Vertex (VX) drugs, digitoxin, and various drug mixtures, and ELISA assays were used to assess suppression of baseline and TNFα-activated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional responses to these drugs were assessed by RNA-seq and compared with gene expression in AAV-[wildtype]CFTR-treated IB3-1 (S9) cells. We also compared in vitro gene expression signatures with in vivo data from biopsied nasal epithelial cells from digitoxin-treated CF patients.
RESULTS: CF cells exposed to digitoxin exhibited significant suppression of both TNFα/NFκB signaling and downstream secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and GM-CSF, with or without co-treatment with VX drugs. No evidence of drug-drug interference was observed. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene therapy-treated CF lung cells induced changes in 3134 genes. Among these, 32.6% were altered by digitoxin treatment in the same direction. Shared functional gene ontology themes for genes suppressed by both digitoxin and gene therapy included inflammation (84 gene signature), and cell-cell interactions and fibrosis (49 gene signature), while genes elevated by both were enriched for epithelial differentiation (82 gene signature). A new analysis of mRNA data from digitoxin-treated CF patients showed consistent trends in expression for genes in these signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant gene therapy-emulating activities of digitoxin may contribute to enhancing the efficacy of currently licensed correctors and potentiators in CF patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Q Yang, A R Soltis, G Sukumar, X Zhang, H Caohuy, J Freedy, C L Dalgard, M D Wilkerson, H B Pollard, B S Pollard<br><b>Journal:</b> Respir.

Complications are myriad and arise as a result of complex pathological pathways 'downstream' to a point mutation in DNA, and include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia and pain, and ultimately risk of cumulative organ damage with reduced lifespan of affected individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies will be widely available to most patients with sickle cell disease. To date, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children, and significantly ameliorated by gene therapy in a handful of subjects who have only limited follow-up thus far. During a timespan in which over 20 agents were approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration, similar approval was granted for only two drugs for sickle cell disease (hydroxyurea and L-glutamine) despite the higher prevalence of sickle cell disease. This trajectory appears to be changing, as the lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry who, in the last decade, have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction, inhibition of intracellular HbS polymerization, inhibition of oxidant stress and inflammation, and perturbation of the activation of the endothelium and other blood components (e.g. platelets, white blood cells, coagulation proteins) involved in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. In this article, we present a crash-course review of disease-modifying approaches (minus hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) for patients with sickle cell disease currently, or recently, tested in clinical trials in the era following approval of hydroxyurea.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Marcus A Carden, Jane Little<br><b>Journal:</b> Haematologica<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1592-8721<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.43<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.077<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413089">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Therapeutic Prospects of mRNA-Based Gene Therapy for Glioblastoma.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The treatment of glioblastoma has been a big challenge for decades in the oncological field mainly owing to its unique biological characteristics, such as high heterogeneity, diffusing invasiveness, and capacity to resist conventional therapies.

Sphingolipidoses (SP), which usually involve the loss of sphingolipid hydrolase function, are of lysosomal origin, and represent an important group of rare diseases among lysosomal storage disorders. Initial treatments consisted of enzyme replacement therapy, but, in recent decades, various therapeutic approaches have been developed. However, these commonly used treatments for SP fail to be fully effective and do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. New approaches, such as genome editing, have great potential for both the treatment and study of sphingolipidoses. Here, we review the most recent advances in the treatment and modelling of SP through the application of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. CRISPR-Cas9 is currently the most widely used method for genome editing. This technique is versatile; it can be used for altering the regulation of genes involved in sphingolipid degradation and synthesis pathways, interrogating gene function, generating knock out models, or knocking in mutations. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is being used as an approach to disease treatment, but more frequently it is utilized to create models of disease. New CRISPR-Cas9-based tools of gene editing with diminished off-targeting effects are evolving and seem to be more promising for the correction of individual mutations.

The CFTR protein helps to maintain the balance of salt and water on many body surfaces, such as the lung surface. When the protein is not working correctly, chloride becomes trapped in cells, then water cannot hydrate the cellular surface and the mucus covering the cells becomes thick and sticky. Furthermore, a defective CFTR appears to produce a redox imbalance in epithelial cells and extracellular fluids and to cause an abnormal generation of reactive oxygen species: as a consequence, oxidative stress has been implicated as a causative factor in the aetiology of the process. Moreover, massive evidences show that defective CFTR gives rise to extracellular GSH level decrease and elevated glucose concentrations in airway surface liquid (ASL), thus encouraging lung infection by pathogens in the CF advancement. Recent research in progress aims to rediscover a possible role of mitochondria in CF. Here the latest new and recent studies on mitochondrial bioenergetics are collected. Surprisingly, they have enabled us to ascertain that mitochondria have a leading role in opposing the high ASL glucose level as well as oxidative stress in CF.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria Favia, Lidia de Bari, Antonella Bobba, Anna Atlante<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698802">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Arachidonic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid Metabolites in the Airways of Adults With Cystic Fibrosis: Effect of Docosahexaenoic Acid Supplementation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by genetic mutations in CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein.

We hypothesized that DHA supplementation could restore the production of DHA-derived products and possibly contribute to a better control of the chronic pulmonary inflammation observed in CF subjects.

Due to their suitable size, short gestation period, and abundant secretion of milk, sheep and goats have become important model animals in agricultural, pharmaceutical, and biomedical research. Genome engineering has been widely applied to sheep and goat research. Pronuclear injection and somatic cell nuclear transfer represent the two primary procedures for the generation of genetically modified sheep and goats. Further assisted tools have emerged to enhance the efficiency of genetic modification and to simplify the generation of genetically modified founders. These tools include sperm-mediated gene transfer, viral vectors, RNA interference, recombinases, transposons, and endonucleases. Of these tools, the four classes of site-specific endonucleases (meganucleases, ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPRs) have attracted wide attention due to their DNA double-strand break-inducing role, which enable desired DNA modifications based on the stimulation of native cellular DNA repair mechanisms. Currently, CRISPR systems dominate the field of genome editing. Gene-edited sheep and goats, generated using these tools, provide valuable models for investigations on gene functions, improving animal breeding, producing pharmaceuticals in milk, improving animal disease resistance, recapitulating human diseases, and providing hosts for the growth of human organs. In addition, more promising derivative tools of CRISPR systems have emerged such as base editors which enable the induction of single-base alterations without any requirements for homology-directed repair or DNA donor. These precise editors are helpful for revealing desirable phenotypes and correcting genetic diseases controlled by single bases. This review highlights the advances of genome engineering in sheep and goats over the past four decades with particular emphasis on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 systems.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Peter Kalds, Shiwei Zhou, Bei Cai, Jiao Liu, Ying Wang, Bjoern Petersen, Tad Sonstegard, Xiaolong Wang, Yulin Chen<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-8021<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.888<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552084">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Is selecting better than modifying? An investigation of arguments against germline gene editing as compared to preimplantation genetic diagnosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Recent scientific advances in the field of gene editing have led to a renewed discussion on the moral acceptability of human germline modifications. Gene editing methods can be used on human embryos and gametes in order to change DNA sequences that are associated with diseases. Modifying the human germline, however, is currently illegal in many countries but has been suggested as a 'last resort' option in some reports. In contrast, preimplantation genetic (PGD) diagnosis is now a well-established practice within reproductive medicine. Both methods can be used to prevent children from being born with severe genetic diseases.
MAIN TEXT: This paper focuses on four moral concerns raised in the debate about germline gene editing (GGE) and applies them to the practice of PGD for comparison: Violation of human dignity, disrespect of the autonomy and the physical integrity of the future child, discrimination of people living with a disability and the fear of slippery slope towards immoral usage of the technology, e.g. designing children for specific third party interests. Our analysis did not reveal any fundamental differences with regard to the four concerns.
CONCLUSION: We argue that with regard to the four arguments analyzed in this paper germline gene editing should be considered morally (at least) as acceptable as the selection of genomes on the basis of PGD. However, we also argue that any application of GGE in reproductive medicine should be put on hold until thorough and comprehensive laws have been implemented to prevent the abuse of GGE for non-medical enhancement.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Alix Lenia V Hammerstein, Matthias Eggel, Nikola Biller-Andorno<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Med Ethics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1472-6939<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.085<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752935">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cell-based therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an example of interstitial lung diseases that is characterized by chronic, progressive, and fibrotic lung injuries. During lung fibrosis, normal healthy lung tissues are replaced by remarkably destroyed alveolar architecture and altered extracellular cell matrix. These changes eventually cause severe disruption of the tightly-controlled gas exchange process and reduction of lung compliance that ultimately lead to both respiratory failure and death. In the last decade, progress has been made toward understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, and two novel disease-modifying therapies were approved. However, finding more effective treatments for pulmonary fibrosis is still a challenge, with its incidence continues to increase globally, which is associated with significantly high mortality, morbidity and economical healthcare burden. Different stem cell types have recently emerged as a promising therapy for human diseases, including lung fibrosis, with numerous studies on the identification, characterization, proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. A large body of both basic and pre-clinical research on stem cells has been recently translated to patient care worldwide. Herein, we review recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of IPF, and types of cells used in IPF cell-based therapies, including alveolar and mixed lung epithelial cells, different stem cell types (MSCs, ADSCs, IPSCs…etc.), endogenous lung tissue-specific stem cells, and circulating endothelial progenitors (EPCs). We also discuss recent studies on the applications of these cells in IPF therapy and their delivery routes, effective doses for cell therapy, and timing of delivery. Finally, we discuss attractive recent and current clinical trials conducted on cell-based therapy for IPF.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-28<br><b>Authors:</b> Qi Lu, Ahmed H K El-Hashash<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Investig<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2306-9759<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.90<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.682<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559309">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Long QT Syndrome: Genetics and Future Perspective.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited primary arrhythmia syndrome that may present with malignant arrhythmia and, rarely, risk of sudden death. The clinical symptoms include palpitations, syncope, and anoxic seizures secondary to ventricular arrhythmia, classically torsade de pointes. This predisposition to malignant arrhythmia is from a cardiac ion channelopathy that results in delayed repolarization of the cardiomyocyte action potential. The QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram is a summation of the individual cellular ventricular action potential durations, and hence is a surrogate marker of the abnormal cellular membrane repolarization. Severely affected phenotypes administered current standard of care therapies may not be fully protected from the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. There are 17 different subtypes of LQTS associated with monogenic mutations of 15 autosomal dominant genes. It is now possible to model the various LQTS phenotypes through the generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. RNA interference can silence or suppress the expression of mutant genes. Thus, RNA interference can be a potential therapeutic intervention that may be employed in LQTS to knock out mutant mRNAs which code for the defective proteins. CRISPR/Cas9 is a genome editing technology that offers great potential in elucidating gene function and a potential therapeutic strategy for monogenic disease. Further studies are required to determine whether CRISPR/Cas9 can be employed as an efficacious and safe rescue of the LQTS phenotype. Current progress has raised opportunities to generate in vitro human cardiomyocyte models for drug screening and to explore gene therapy through genome editing.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Eimear Wallace, Linda Howard, Min Liu, Timothy O'Brien, Deirdre Ward, Sanbing Shen, Terence Prendiville<br><b>Journal:</b> Pediatr Cardiol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1432-1971<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.29<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.51<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.764<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440766">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> An Overview of the CRISPR-Based Genomic- and Epigenome-Editing System: Function, Applications, and Challenges.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Developing a new strategy for an efficient targeted genome editing has always been a great perspective in biology.

Among them, the HBB IVS2-654 (C > T) mutation, which is in the intron, creates an aberrant splicing site. Bone marrow transplantation for curing β-thalassaemia is limited due to the lack of matched donors. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), as a widely used tool for gene editing, is able to target specific sequence and create double-strand break (DSB), which can be combined with the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) to correct mutations. In this study, according to two different strategies, the HBB IVS2-654 mutation was seamlessly corrected in iPSCs by CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN. To reduce the occurrence of secondary cleavage, a more efficient strategy was adopted. The corrected iPSCs kept pluripotency and genome stability. Moreover, they could differentiate normally. Through CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN, our study provides improved strategies for gene correction of β-Thalassaemia, and the expression of the HBB gene can be restored, which can be used for gene therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Xiong, Yingjun Xie, Yi Yang, Yanting Xue, Ding Wang, Shouheng Lin, Diyu Chen, Dian Lu, Lina He, Bing Song, Yinghong Yang, Xiaofang Sun<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

This study endeavored to assess population genetics consequences of such therapies. Computer simulations were used to evaluate the heterogeneity in causal alleles for polygenic diseases that could exist among geographically distinct populations. The results show that although heterogeneity would not be easily detectable by epidemiological studies following population admixture, even significant heterogeneity would not impede the outcomes of preventive gene therapies. Preventive gene therapies designed to correct causal alleles to a naturally-occurring neutral state of nucleotides would lower the prevalence of polygenic early- to middle-age-onset diseases in proportion to the decreased population relative risk attributable to the edited alleles. The outcome would manifest differently for late-onset diseases, for which the therapies would result in a delayed disease onset and decreased lifetime risk; however, the lifetime risk would increase again with prolonging population life expectancy, which is a likely consequence of such therapies. If the preventive heritable gene therapies were to be applied on a large scale, the decreasing frequency of risk alleles in populations would reduce the disease risk or delay the age of onset, even with a fraction of the population receiving such therapies. With ongoing population admixture, all groups would benefit over generations.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Roman Teo Oliynyk<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658652">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Reversal of Surfactant Protein B Deficiency in Patient Specific Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Derived Lung Organoids by Gene Therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Surfactant protein B (SFTPB) deficiency is a fatal disease affecting newborn infants.

Whole genome sequencing indicated a single integration site on mouse chromosome 8 (8qB2) with ~6 gene copies. hCFTR+ offspring were bred to murine Cftr KO mice, producing hCFTR+/mCftr- (H+/m-) mice, which had normal survival, growth and goblet cell function as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Expression studies showed hCFTR protein and transcripts in tissues typically expressing mCftr.

A humanised mouse model of β-thalassemia was used, in which heterozygous animals are anaemic with splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Intrahepatic in utero injections of a β globin-expressing lentiviral vector (GLOBE), were performed in fetuses at E13.5 of gestation. We analysed animals at 12 and 32 weeks of age, for vector copy number in bone marrow, peripheral blood liver and spleen and we performed integration site analysis. Compared to noninjected heterozygous animals IUGT normalised blood haemoglobin levels and spleen weight. Integration site analysis showed polyclonality. The left ventricular ejection fraction measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in treated heterozygous animals was similar to that of normal non-β-thalassemic mice but significantly higher than untreated heterozygous thalassemia mice suggesting that IUGT ameliorated poor cardiac function.

While oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilation, and pressure-reducing medications help alleviate these symptoms, they do not treat the underlying disease. Mechanical activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channels contributes to the development of pulmonary vascular disease, and overexpression of the high homology (HH) domain of the TRPV4-associated transmembrane protein CD98 has been shown to inhibit this pathway. Here, we describe the development of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the CD98 HH domain in which the AAV serotypes and promoters have been optimized for efficient and specific delivery to pulmonary cells. AAV-mediated gene delivery of the CD98 HH domain inhibited TRPV4 mechanotransduction in a specific manner and protected against pulmonary vascular leakage in a human lung Alveolus-on-a-Chip model. As AAV has been used clinically to deliver other gene therapies, these data raise the possibility of using this type of targeted approach to develop mechanotherapeutics that target the TRPV4 pathway for treatment of pulmonary edema in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Juan Li, Amy M Wen, Ratnakar Potla, Ezekiel Benshirim, Ariel Seebarran, Maximilian A Benz, Olivier Y F Henry, Benjamin D Matthews, Rachelle Prantil-Baun, Sarah E Gilpin, Oren Levy, Donald E Ingber<br><b>Journal:</b> APL Bioeng<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-2877<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.2<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803860">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Monkeys mutant for PKD1 recapitulate human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) caused by PKD1 mutations is one of the most common hereditary disorders. However, the key pathological processes underlying cyst development and exacerbation in pre-symptomatic stages remain unknown, because rodent models do not recapitulate critical disease phenotypes, including disease onset in heterozygotes. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generate ADPKD models with PKD1 mutations in cynomolgus monkeys. As in humans and mice, near-complete PKD1 depletion induces severe cyst formation mainly in collecting ducts. Importantly, unlike in mice, PKD1 heterozygote monkeys exhibit cyst formation perinatally in distal tubules, possibly reflecting the initial pathology in humans. Many monkeys in these models survive after cyst formation, and cysts progress with age. Furthermore, we succeed in generating selective heterozygous mutations using allele-specific targeting. We propose that our models elucidate the onset and progression of ADPKD, which will serve as a critical basis for establishing new therapeutic strategies, including drug treatments.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Tomoyuki Tsukiyama, Kenichi Kobayashi, Masataka Nakaya, Chizuru Iwatani, Yasunari Seita, Hideaki Tsuchiya, Jun Matsushita, Kahoru Kitajima, Ikuo Kawamoto, Takahiro Nakagawa, Koji Fukuda, Teppei Iwakiri, Hiroyuki Izumi, Iori Itagaki, Shinji Kume, Hiroshi Maegawa, Ryuichi Nishinakamura, Saori Nishio, Shinichiro Nakamura, Akihiro Kawauchi, Masatsugu Ema<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822676">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Scope for Thalassemia Gene Therapy by Disruption of Aberrant Regulatory Elements.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The common IVSI-110 (G>A) β-thalassemia mutation is a paradigm for intronic disease-causing mutations and their functional repair by non-homologous end joining-mediated disruption.

Acute and chronic SCD-related complications increase with older age, and therapies are urgently needed to treat adults. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative therapy, but has been used less frequently in adults compared to children. This is, in part, due to (1) greater chronic organ damage, limiting tolerability to myeloablative conditioning regimens, (2) a higher rate of HSCT-related complications in adults versus children with SCD, and (3) limited coverage by public and private health insurance. Newer approaches using nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT regimens have demonstrated better safety and tolerability, with high rates of stable engraftment in SCD adults.

Recently, miRNAs (miRNAs), a large family of small, non-coding regulatory RNAs were identified in these networks as regulators of endogenous genes by exerting post-transcriptional gene regulation activity in a broad range of eukaryotic species. Dysregulation of miRNA expression correlates with aberrant gene expression and can play an essential role in human health and disease. In the context of the lung, miRNAs have been implicated in organogenesis programming, such as proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Gain- or loss-of-function studies revealed their pivotal roles as regulators of disease development, potential therapeutic candidates/targets, and clinical biomarkers. An altered microRNAome has been attributed to several pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Considering the relevant roles and functions of miRNAs under physiological and pathological conditions, they may lead to the invention of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. This review will focus on recent advances in understanding the role of miRNAs in lung development, lung health, and diseases, while also exploring the progress and prospects of their application as therapeutic leads or as biomarkers.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Rajib Kumar Dutta, Srinivasan Chinnapaiyan, Hoshang Unwalla<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Nucleic Acids<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2162-2531<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.011<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655261">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Development of Functional Non-Viral Vectors for Gene Delivery.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene therapy is manipulation in/of gene expression in specific cells/tissue to treat diseases. This manipulation is carried out by introducing exogenous nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, into the cell. Because of their negative charge and considerable larger size, the delivery of these molecules, in general, should be mediated by gene vectors. Non-viral vectors, as promising delivery systems, have received considerable attention due to their low cytotoxicity and non-immunogenicity. As research continued, more and more functional non-viral vectors have emerged. They not only have the ability to deliver a gene into the cells but also have other functions, such as the performance of fluorescence imaging, which aids in monitoring their progress, targeted delivery, and biodegradation. Recently, many reviews related to non-viral vectors, such as polymers and cationic lipids, have been reported. However, there are few reviews regarding functional non-viral vectors. This review summarizes the common functional non-viral vectors developed in the last ten years and their potential applications in the future. The transfection efficiency and the transport mechanism of these materials were also discussed in detail. We hope that this review can help researchers design more new high-efficiency and low-toxicity multifunctional non-viral vectors, and further accelerate the progress of gene therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Suryaji Patil, Yong-Guang Gao, Xiao Lin, Yu Li, Kai Dang, Ye Tian, Wen-Juan Zhang, Shan-Feng Jiang, Abdul Qadir, Ai-Rong Qian<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690044">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Editorial: Emerging Therapeutic Approaches for Cystic Fibrosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Miquéias Lopes-Pacheco, Nicoletta Pedemonte, Anthony Kicic<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Pharmacol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1663-9812<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.86<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.256<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849681">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Era of Genomic Medicine: A Narrative Review on CRISPR Technology as a Potential Therapeutic Tool for Human Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) provides acquired immunity in microorganisms against exogenous DNA that may hinder the survival of the organism. Pioneering work by Doudna and Charpentier in 2012 resulted in the creation of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool on the basis of this concept. The aim of this was to create a rapid, efficient, and versatile genome-editing tool to facilitate genetic manipulation. The mechanism relies on two components: the RNA guide which acts as a sentinel and a Cas protein complex which functions as a highly precise molecular knife. The guide RNA can be modified to match a DNA sequence of interest in the cell and accordingly be used to rectify mutations that may otherwise cause disease. Within a few years following the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, its usage has become ubiquitous. Its influence extends into many fields of biological sciences from biotechnology and biochemistry to molecular biology and biomedical sciences. The following review aims at shedding some light on to the applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool in the field of biomedical sciences, particularly gene therapy.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) advancements have facilitated and accelerated the process of identifying genetic variations. Adopting NGS with Whole-Genome and RNA sequencing in a diagnostic context has the potential to improve disease-risk detection in support of precision medicine and drug discovery. Several bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to strengthen variant interpretation by efficiently processing and analyzing sequence data, whereas many published results show how genomics data can be proactively incorporated into medical practices and improve utilization of clinical information. To utilize the wealth of genomics and health, there is a crucial need to generate appropriate gene-disease annotation repositories accessed through modern technology.
RESULTS: Our focus here is to create a comprehensive database with mobile access to actionable genes and classified diseases, considered the foundation for clinical genomics and precision medicine. We present a publicly available iOS app, PAS-Gen, which invites global users to freely download it on iPhone and iPad devices, quickly adopt its easy to use interface, and search for genes and related diseases. PAS-Gen was developed using Swift, XCODE, and PHP scripting that uses Web and MySQL database servers, which includes over 59,000 protein-coding and non-coding genes, and over 90,000 classified gene-disease associations. PAS-Gen is founded on the clinical and scientific premise that easier healthcare and genomics data sharing will accelerate future medical discoveries.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a cutting-edge gene-disease database with a smart phone application, integrating information on classified diseases and related genes. The PAS-Gen app will assist researchers, medical practitioners, and pharmacists by providing a broad and view of genes that may be implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. This tool with accelerate users' abilities to understand the genetic basis of human complex diseases and by assimilating genomic and phenotypic data will support future work to identify gene-specific designer drugs, target precise molecular fingerprints for tumors, suggest appropriate drug therapies, predict individual susceptibility to disease, and diagnose and treat rare illnesses.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Zeeshan Ahmed, Saman Zeeshan, Ruoyun Xiong, Bruce T Liang<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2001-1326<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586224">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Interspecies Organogenesis for Human Transplantation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Blastocyst complementation combined with gene editing is an emerging approach in the field of regenerative medicine that could potentially solve the worldwide problem of organ shortages for transplantation.

Foetal liver cells develop in an environment called a hematopoietic stem cell niche composed of several cell types, where stem cells can proliferate and give rise to mature blood cells. Embryologically, at about the third week of gestation, the liver appears, and it grows rapidly from the fifth to 10th week under WNT/β-Catenin signaling pathway stimulation, which induces hepatic progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation into hepatocytes. Development of new strategies and identification of new cell sources should represent the main aim in liver regenerative medicine and cell therapy. Cells isolated from organs with endodermal origin, like the liver, bile ducts, and pancreas, could be preferable cell sources. Furthermore, stem cells isolated from these organs could be more susceptible to differentiate into mature liver cells after transplantation with respect to stem cells isolated from organs or tissues with a different embryological origin. The foetal liver possesses unique features given the co-existence of cells having endodermal and mesenchymal origin, and it could be highly available source candidate for regenerative medicine in both the liver and pancreas. Taking into account these advantages, the foetal liver can be the highest potential and available cell source for cell therapy regarding liver diseases and diabetes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Antonella Giancotti, Marco Monti, Lorenzo Nevi, Samira Safarikia, Valentina D’Ambrosio, Roberto Brunelli, Cristina Pajno, Sara Corno, Violante Di Donato, Angela Musella, Michele Francesco Chiappetta, Daniela Bosco, Pierluigi Benedetti Panici, Domenico Alvaro, Vincenzo Cardinale<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426422">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Next-generation of targeted AAVP vectors for systemic transgene delivery against cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Bacteriophage (phage) have attractive advantages as delivery systems compared with mammalian viruses, but have been considered poor vectors because they lack evolved strategies to confront and overcome mammalian cell barriers to infective agents. We reasoned that improved efficacy of delivery might be achieved through structural modification of the viral capsid to avoid pre- and postinternalization barriers to mammalian cell transduction. We generated multifunctional hybrid adeno-associated virus/phage (AAVP) particles to enable simultaneous display of targeting ligands on the phage's minor pIII proteins and also degradation-resistance motifs on the very numerous pVIII coat proteins. This genetic strategy of directed evolution bestows a next-generation of AAVP particles that feature resistance to fibrinogen adsorption or neutralizing antibodies and ability to escape endolysosomal degradation. This results in superior gene transfer efficacy in vitro and also in preclinical mouse models of rodent and human solid tumors. Thus, the unique functions of our next-generation AAVP particles enable improved targeted gene delivery to tumor cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Keittisak Suwan, Teerapong Yata, Sajee Waramit, Justyna M Przystal, Charlotte A Stoneham, Kaoutar Bentayebi, Paladd Asavarut, Aitthiphon Chongchai, Peraphan Pothachareon, Koon-Yang Lee, Supachai Topanurak, Tracey L Smith, Juri G Gelovani, Richard L Sidman, Renata Pasqualini, Wadih Arap, Amin Hajitou<br><b>Journal:</b> Proc.

Given recent promising results from novel microRNA-based medicines, we discuss the potential applications of microRNAs for clinical assessments of SMA disease progression and treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Tai-Heng Chen, Jun-An Chen<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31738166">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Peptide-Targeted Polyplexes for Aerosol-Mediated Gene Delivery to CD49f-Overexpressing Tumor Lesions in Lung.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Peptide ligands can enhance delivery of nucleic acid-loaded nanoparticles to tumors by promoting their cell binding and internalization. Lung tumor lesions accessible from the alveolar side can be transfected, in principle, using gene vectors delivered as an aerosol. The cell surface marker CD49f (Integrin α6) is frequently upregulated in metastasizing, highly aggressive tumors. In this study, we utilize a CD49f binding peptide coupled to linear polyethylenimine (LPEI) promoting gene delivery into CD49f-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro and into lung lesions in vivo. We have synthesized a molecular conjugate based on LPEI covalently attached to the CD49f binding peptide CYESIKVAVS via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer. Particles formed with plasmid DNA were small (<200 nm) and could be aerosolized without causing major aggregation or particle loss. In vitro, CD49f targeting significantly improved plasmid uptake and reporter gene expression on both human and murine tumor cell lines. For evaluation in vivo, localization and morphology of 4T1 murine triple-negative breast cancer tumor lesions in the lung of syngeneic BALB/c mice were identified by MRI. Polyplexes applied via intratracheal aerosolization were well tolerated and resulted in measurable transgene activity of the reporter gene firefly luciferase in tumor areas by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Transfectability of tumors correlated with their accessibility for the aerosol. With CD49f-targeted polyplexes, luciferase activity was considerably increased and was restricted to the tumor area.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Taschauer, Wolfram Polzer, Fatih Alioglu, Magdalena Billerhart, Simon Decker, Theresa Kittelmann, Emanuela Geppl, Salma Elmenofi, Martin Zehl, Ernst Urban, Haider Sami, Manfred Ogris<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Nucleic Acids<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2162-2531<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.011<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31734558">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficient Delivery of MicroRNA and AntimiRNA Molecules Using an Argininocalix[4]arene Macrocycle.<br><b>Abstract:</b> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules acting as gene regulators by repressing translation or by inducing degradation of the target RNA transcripts. Altered expression of miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of many severe human diseases, opening new avenues in the field of therapeutic strategies, i.e., miRNA targeting or miRNA mimicking. In this context, the efficient and non-toxic delivery of premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules might be of great interest. The aim of the present paper is to determine whether an argininocalix[4]arene is able to efficiently deliver miRNA, premiRNA, and antimiRNA molecules to target cells, preserving their biological activity. This study points out that (1) the toxicity of argininocalix[4]arene 1 is low, and it can be proposed for long-term treatment of target cells, being that this feature is a pre-requisite for the development of therapeutic protocols; (2) the delivery of premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules is efficient, being higher when compared with reference gold standards available; and (3) the biological activity of the premiRNAs and antimiRNAs is maintained. This was demonstrated using the argininocalix[4]arene 1 in miRNA therapeutic approaches performed on three well-described experimental model systems: (1) the induction of apoptosis by antimiR-221 in glioma U251 cells; (2) the induction of apoptosis by premiR-124 in U251 cells; and (3) the inhibition of pro-inflammatory IL-8 and IL-6 genes in cystic fibrosis IB3-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that the argininocalix[4]arene 1 should be considered a very useful delivery system for efficient transfer to target cells of both premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules, preserving their biological activity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Gasparello, Michela Lomazzi, Chiara Papi, Elisabetta D'Aversa, Francesco Sansone, Alessandro Casnati, Gaetano Donofrio, Roberto Gambari, Alessia Finotti<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Nucleic Acids<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2162-2531<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.011<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31733592">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Progress in the Development of Chitosan-Based Biomaterials for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Over the last few decades, chitosan has become a good candidate for tissue engineering applications.

The formation of NETs, as well as relevant regulatory mechanisms, physiological factors, and pharmacological agents have not been systematically discussed in the context of their beneficial and pathological aspects. Novel forms of NET formation including vital NET formation continue to be uncovered, however, there remain fundamental questions around established mechanisms such as NADPH-oxidase (Nox)-dependent and Nox-independent NET formation. Whether NET formation takes place in the tissue versus the bloodstream, internal factors (e.g. reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and transcription factor activation), and external factors (e.g. alkaline pH and hypertonic conditions), have all been demonstrated to influence specific NET pathways. Elements of neutrophil biology such as transcription and mitochondria, which were previously of unknown significance, have been identified as critical mediators of NET formation through facilitating chromatin decondensation and generating ROS, respectively. While promising therapeutics inhibiting ROS, transcription, and gasdermin D are being investigated, neutrophil phagocytosis plays a critical role in host defense and any therapies targeting NET formation must avoid impairing the physiological functions of these cells. This review summarizes what is known in the many domains of NET research, highlights the most relevant challenges in the field, and inspires new questions that can bring us closer to a unified model of NET formation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Mithunan Ravindran, Meraj A Khan, Nades Palaniyar<br><b>Journal:</b> Biomolecules<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2218-273X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.65<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.525<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416173">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Vascular Niche in Lung Alveolar Development, Homeostasis, and Regeneration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Endothelial cells (ECs) constitute small capillary blood vessels and contribute to delivery of nutrients, oxygen and cellular components to the local tissues, as well as to removal of carbon dioxide and waste products from the tissues. Besides these fundamental functions, accumulating evidence indicates that capillary ECs form the vascular niche. In the vascular niche, ECs reciprocally crosstalk with resident cells such as epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and immune cells to regulate development, homeostasis, and regeneration in various organs. Capillary ECs supply paracrine factors, called angiocrine factors, to the adjacent cells in the niche and orchestrate these processes. Although the vascular niche is anatomically and functionally well-characterized in several organs such as bone marrow and neurons, the effects of endothelial signals on other resident cells and anatomy of the vascular niche in the lung have not been well-explored.

In case this could also be operative in biliary epithelial cells, this may have implication for the pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We here evaluated the transport of PC across polarized cholangiocytes. Therefore, the biliary tumor cell line Mz-ChA-1 was grown to confluency. In transwell culture systems the translocation of PC to the apical compartment was analyzed. After 21 days in culture, polarized Mz-ChA-1 cells revealed a predominant apical translocation of choline containing phospholipids including PC with minimal intracellular accumulation. Transport was suppressed by TJ destruction employing chemical inhibitors and pretreatment with siRNA to TJ forming proteins as well as the apical transmembrane mucin 3 as PC acceptor. Apical translocation was dependent on a negative apical electrical potential created by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the anion exchange protein 2 (AE2). It was stimulated by apical application of secretory mucins. The results indicated the existence of a paracellular PC passage across apical/lateral TJ of the polarized biliary epithelial tumor cell line Mz-ChA-1.

Although the initiative is apparently oriented towards developing individuals that would excel in society, critical voices raise the concerns about that this approach would generate and need for a reflection on the ethical, social and legal implications of these techniques and their implementation in society. We reviewed the literature about these issues throughout their historical records to date, focusing on the moral arguments and non-clinical aspects that affect the legal and social environment. We have observed various trends of thought with divergent positions (proactive, preventive, and regulatory) as well as a large number of articles that try to reconcile the different approaches. This review illustrates a series of concepts from the ethics and philosophy fields which are frequently used in studies that evaluate the ethical implications of germline genetic enhancement, such as dignity, benefit, autonomy, and identity. In addition, amongst the many unresolved controversies surrounding genetic enhancement, we identify procreative beneficence, genetic disassociation, gender selection, the value of disability, embryo chimerization, and the psychosocial inequality of potentially enhanced individuals as crucial. We also develop possible scenarios for future debate. We consider especially important the definition and specification of three aspects which are essential for the deployment of new reproductive technologies: the moral status of the embryo undergoing enhancement, the legal status of the enhanced individual, and the responsibility of the agents executing the enhancement. Finally, we propose the precautionary principle as a means to navigate ethical uncertainties.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Ignacio Macpherson, María Victoria Roqué, Ignacio Segarra<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-8021<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.888<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552088">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> PRC1 promotes GLI1-dependent osteopontin expression in association with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and aggravates liver fibrosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: PRC1 (Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1) regulates microtubules organization and functions as a novel regulator in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats has been used as a model of BPD, as indicated by lung architectural change and alveolar simplification that resembles clinical feature of BPD. ß-defensin-2 (BD2) plays an important role in lung diseases by inhibiting inflammation response. However, little is known about its role in BPD. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of human BD2 (hBD2) gene on hyperoxia-induced animal model of BPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS The neonatal rats were exposed to 90% oxygen (O₂) continuously for 14 days to mimic the BPD-like lung injury. These rats were then randomly assigned to the following four groups: in room air (air), in 90% O₂, in 90% O₂ with null adenovirus vector infection (O₂+Ad), and in 90% O₂ with gene therapy through adenovirus transfected hBD2 (O₂+Ad-hBD2). Morphology of lungs, pulmonary function and expression of inflammatory cytokines on P7, P10, P14, and P21 were documented and compared across the 4 groups. RESULTS The overexpression of hBD2 mediated by the adenovirus vector was successfully constructed. hBD2 gene therapy increased hBD2 mRNA expression, increased radial alveolar count (RAC), lung volume and compliance, decreased mean linear intercept (MLI), tissue damping, and elastance. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were inhibited and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 was increased in the lungs of rats in O₂+Ad-hBD2 group. CONCLUSIONS In hyperoxia-induced rat models of BPD, hBD2 promotes alveolarization and improves pulmonary function. The mechanism may contribute in alleviating inflammation response and inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors including IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-alpha.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Yuanyuan Sun, Cuie Chen, Tianwei Di, Jiaojiao Yang, Kai Wang, Yanke Zhu, Ronghe Zhu, Aihua Zhou, Yan Qian<br><b>Journal:</b> Med.

METHODS: Semistructured, face-to-face, and in-depth interviews were carried out with parents of children with suspected IRDs in this qualitative study. Inductive content analysis was used for data processing.
RESULTS: Forty-six parents participated in our interviews, and 47.8% of them supported genetic testing for following four main reasons: to help in making informed reproductive health decisions, to prepare for novel potential treatment, to identify the underlying causes of IRDs, and to satisfy curiosity about the heredity of IRDs. Among them, 19.6% were opposed to the testing for four main reasons, namely lack of therapeutic benefit, difficulty in affording the testing cost, doubt in the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, and the presence of concerns about the limitations of genetic testing. 47.8% of the parents expressed concerns that the genetic findings might lead to potential psychological stress.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that nearly half of the parents supported genetic testing mainly for family planning, and a fifth of the parents were opposed to the testing mainly for lack of therapeutic benefit. Moreover, half of the parents expressed concern that a positive genetic result may create potential psychological burden to the parents and children.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-02<br><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhang, Zhirong Wang, Sijian Huang, Limei Sun, Shiying Zhao, Yimin Zhong, Huiming Xiao, Xiaoyan Ding<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Genet Genomic Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2324-9269<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.806<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373165">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Next Generation Sequencing in Newborn Screening in the United Kingdom National Health Service.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has the potential to improve the diagnostic and prognostic utility of newborn screening programmes. This study assesses the feasibility of automating NGS on dried blood spot (DBS) DNA in a United Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) laboratory. An NGS panel targeting the entire coding sequence of five genes relevant to disorders currently screened for in newborns in the UK was validated on DBS DNA. An automated process for DNA extraction, NGS and bioinformatics analysis was developed. The process was tested on DBS to determine feasibility, turnaround time and cost. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 100% and analytical specificity was 99.96%, with a mean 99.5% concordance of variant calls between DBS and venous blood samples in regions with ≥30× coverage (96.8% across all regions; all variant calls were single nucleotide variants (SNVs), with indel performance not assessed). The pipeline enabled processing of up to 1000 samples a week with a turnaround time of four days from receipt of sample to reporting.

Multiplexed functional assays, in which the functional effects of thousands of genomic variants are assessed simultaneously, are increasingly generating data that can be used as additional evidence for or against variant pathogenicity. Such assays have the potential to resolve variants of uncertain significance, thereby increasing the clinical utility of genomic testing. Existing standards from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) and new guidelines from the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) establish the role of functional data in variant interpretation, but do not address the specific challenges or advantages of using functional data derived from multiplexed assays. Here, we build on these existing guidelines to provide recommendations to experimentalists for the production and reporting of multiplexed functional data and to clinicians for the evaluation and use of such data.

Our recommendations to clinicians and diagnostic labs on how to evaluate the quality of multiplexed functional datasets, and how different datasets could be incorporated into the ACMG/AMP variant-interpretation framework, will hopefully clarify whether and how such data should be used.

One solution to this 'missing heritability problem' may be rare missense variants, which are individually scarce but collectively abundant. However, the phenotypic impact of rare variants is under-appreciated as gene function is normally studied in the context of a single 'wild-type' sequence. Here, we explore the impact of naturally occurring missense variants in the human population on the cytosolic antibody receptor TRIM21, using volunteer cells with variant haplotypes, CRISPR gene editing and functional reconstitution. In combination with data from a panel of computational predictors, the results suggest that protein robustness and purifying selection ensure that function is remarkably well-maintained despite coding variation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Zeng, Greg Slodkowicz, Leo C James<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613747">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Regulated hAAT Expression from a Novel rAAV Vector and Its Application in the Prevention of Type 1 Diabetes.<br><b>Abstract:</b> We, and others, have previously achieved high and sustained levels of transgene expression from viral vectors, such as recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). However, regulatable transgene expression may be preferred in gene therapy for diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which the timing and dosing of the therapeutic gene product play critical roles. In the present study, we generated a positive feedback regulation system for human alpha 1 antitrypsin (hAAT) expression in the rAAV vector. We performed quantitative kinetics studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that this vector system can mediate high levels of inducible transgene expression. Transgene induction could be tailored to occur rapidly or gradually, depending on the dose of the inducing drug, doxycycline (Dox). Conversely, after withdrawal of Dox, the silencing of transgene expression occurred slowly over the course of several weeks. Importantly, rAAV delivery of inducible hAAT significantly prevented T1D development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. These results indicate that this Dox-inducible vector system may facilitate the fine-tuning of transgene expression, particularly for hAAT treatment of human autoimmune diseases, including T1D.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Hongxia Ma, Yuanqing Lu, Keith Lowe, Lonneke van der Meijden-Erkelens, Clive Wasserfall, Mark A Atkinson, Sihong Song<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466263">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The CXCL12/CXCR4 Signaling Axis Retains Neutrophils at Inflammatory Sites in Zebrafish.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The inappropriate retention of neutrophils at inflammatory sites is a major driver of the excessive tissue damage characteristic of respiratory inflammatory diseases including COPD, ARDS, and cystic fibrosis.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) is a key transcription factor that regulates adipogenesis. CEBPA has been shown to be essential for lung maturation, and deficiency of CEBPA expression leads to abnormal lung architecture. However, its specific role in lung fibroblast regulation and fibrosis has not yet been elucidated.
METHODS: Lung fibroblast CEBPA expression, pro-fibrotic and lipofibroblast gene expression were assessed by qRT-PCR. CEBPA gain and loss of function experiments were carried out to evaluate the role of CEBPA in human lung fibroblast activation with and without TGF-β1 treatment. Adipogenesis assay was used to measure the adiopogenic potential of lung fibroblasts. Finally, CRISPR activation system was used to enhance endogenous CEBPA expression.
RESULTS: We found that CEBPA gene expression is significantly decreased in IPF-derived fibroblasts compared to normal lung fibroblasts. CEBPA knockdown in normal human lung fibroblasts enhanced fibroblast pro-fibrotic activation and ECM production. CEBPA over-expression by transient transfection in IPF-derived fibroblasts significantly reduced pro-fibrotic gene expression, ECM deposition and αSMA expression and promoted the formation of lipid droplets measured by Oil Red O staining and increased lipofibroblast gene expression. Inhibition of the histone methyl transferase G9a enhanced CEBPA expression, and the anti-fibrotic effects of G9a inhibition were partially mediated by CEBPA expression. Finally, targeted CRISPR-mediated activation of CEBPA resulted in fibroblasts switching from fibrogenic to lipofibroblast states.
CONCLUSIONS: CEBPA expression is reduced in human IPF fibroblasts and its deficiency reduces adipogenic potential and promotes fibrogenic activation. CEBPA expression can be rescued via an inhibitor of epigenetic repression or by targeted CRISPR activation, leading to reduced fibrogenic activation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Jeffrey A Meridew, Aja Aravamudhan, Giovanni Ligresti, Daniel J Tschumperlin, Qi Tan<br><b>Journal:</b> Respir.

Southeast China is a highly infected area affected by four β-thalassemia mutation types (HBB:c.-78A>G, HBB:c.52A>T, HBB:c.126_129delCTTT, and HBB:c.316-197C>T). Relative haplotype dosage (RHDO), a haplotype-based approach, has shown promise as an application for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD); however, additional family members (such as the proband) are required for haplotype construction. The abovementioned circumstances make RHDO-based NIPD cost prohibitive; additionally, the genetic information of the proband is not always available. Thus, it is necessary to find a practical method to solve these problems.
METHODS: Targeted sequencing was applied to sequence parental genomic DNA and cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA). Parental haplotypes were constructed with the SHAPEIT software based on the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) Phase 3 v5 Southern Han Chinese (CHS) haplotype dataset. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the target region were called and classified, and the fetal mutation inheritance status was deduced using the RHDO method.
RESULTS: Construction of the parental haplotypes and detection of the inherited parental mutations were successfully achieved in five families, despite a suspected recombination event. The status of the affected fetuses is consistent with the results of traditional reverse dot blot (RDB) diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: This research introduced SHAPEIT into the classical RHDO workflow and proved that it is applicable to construct parental haplotypes without information from other family members.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Haoxian Li, Bole Du, Fuman Jiang, Yulai Guo, Yang Wang, Chunsheng Zhang, Xiaojing Zeng, Yuhuan Xie, Shuming Ouyang, Yexing Xian, Min Chen, Weiqiang Liu, Xiaofang Sun<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Genet Genomic Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2324-9269<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.806<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566929">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Engineered amphiphilic peptides enable delivery of proteins and CRISPR-associated nucleases to airway epithelia.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The delivery of biologic cargoes to airway epithelial cells is challenging due to the formidable barriers imposed by its specialized and differentiated cells.

The Multiple Roles of YB-1 in Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Lung cancers and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have some of the worst 5-year survival rates of all cancer types, primarily due to a lack of effective treatment options for most patients. Targeted therapies have shown some promise in thoracic cancers, although efficacy is limited only to patients harboring specific mutations or target expression. Although a number of actionable mutations have now been identified, a large population of thoracic cancer patients have no therapeutic options outside of first-line chemotherapy. It is therefore crucial to identify alternative targets that might lead to the development of new ways of treating patients diagnosed with these diseases. The multifunctional oncoprotein Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) could serve as one such target. Recent studies also link this protein to many inherent behaviors of thoracic cancer cells such as proliferation, invasion, metastasis and involvement in cancer stem-like cells.

One expresses the puromycin N-acetyltransferase-herpes simplex virus I thymidine kinase fusion gene (PACTk), while the other expresses the hygromycin phosphotransferase-herpes simplex virus I thymidine kinase fusion gene (HyTk). Therefore, puromycin and hygromycin double resistance can be used to select for targeted HDAd integration into both alleles. Subsequently, piggyBac-mediated excision of both PACTk and HyTk will confer resistance to gancyclovir, resulting in footprintless HDR at both alleles. However, gene-targeting frequency was not high enough to achieve simultaneous targeting at both alleles. Instead, sequential targeting, whereby the two alleles were targeted one at a time, was required in order to achieve bi-allelic HDR with HDAd.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-31<br><b>Authors:</b> Donna J Palmer, Dustin L Turner, Philip Ng<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2329-0501<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.64<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.487<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31890728">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Inborn Errors of Metabolism in the Era of Untargeted Metabolomics and Lipidomics.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of inherited diseases with variable incidences. IEMs are caused by disrupting enzyme activities in specific metabolic pathways by genetic mutations, either directly or indirectly by cofactor deficiencies, causing altered levels of compounds associated with these pathways. While IEMs may present with multiple overlapping symptoms and metabolites, early and accurate diagnosis of IEMs is critical for the long-term health of affected subjects. The prevalence of IEMs differs between countries, likely because different IEM classifications and IEM screening methods are used. Currently, newborn screening programs exclusively use targeted metabolic assays that focus on limited panels of compounds for selected IEM diseases. Such targeted approaches face the problem of false negative and false positive diagnoses that could be overcome if metabolic screening adopted analyses of a broader range of analytes. Hence, we here review the prospects of using untargeted metabolomics for IEM screening. Untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics do not rely on predefined target lists and can detect as many metabolites as possible in a sample, allowing to screen for many metabolic pathways simultaneously. Examples are given for nontargeted analyses of IEMs, and prospects and limitations of different metabolomics methods are discussed. We conclude that dedicated studies are needed to compare accuracy and robustness of targeted and untargeted methods with respect to widening the scope of IEM diagnostics.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Israa T Ismail, Megan R Showalter, Oliver Fiehn<br><b>Journal:</b> Metabolites<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2218-1989<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.34<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.967<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640247">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Adeno-Associated Virus Technologies and Methods for Targeted Neuronal Manipulation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cell-type-specific expression of molecular tools and sensors is critical to construct circuit diagrams and to investigate the activity and function of neurons within the nervous system.

So, it is imperative to explore its mechanism and find novel targets to improve the outcome. Type II cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG II) has been recently reported to inhibit proliferation and metastasis in several tumors. The present study is to clarify the effect of PKG II combined with l-arginine (l-Arg) on OC cells. SKOV3 and A2780 cells were infected with adenovirus coding cDNA of PKG II to increase PKG II expression and l-Arg was applied to activate this kinase. CCK8 assay, Transwell migration and TUNEL assay were applied to detect the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of the OC cells, respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the level of total and phosphorylated proteins. Our results showed that co-treatment with PKG II and l-Arg inhibited EGF-induced proliferation and the expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), Cyclin E and N-Cadherin, whereas up-regulated the expression of E-Cadherin, abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of EGF, prevented the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as blocked EGF-triggered Raf-MEK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. Our results suggested that PKG II activated by l-Arg could inhibit proliferation and migration and promote the apoptosis of OC cells. Based on the above results and our previous data, it is speculated that PKG II is an inhibitor of cancer with extensive effects.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Yan Wu, Qin Cai, Wei Li, Zhensheng Cai, Ying Liu, Hongfan Li, Ji Pang, Yongchang Chen<br><b>Journal:</b> Biosci.

However, cells of the innate immune system can also sense their local microenvironment and respond to physiological fluctuations in temperature, pH, oxygen and nutrient availability, which are altered during inflammation. Although cells of the immune system experience force and pressure throughout their life cycle, little is known about how these mechanical processes regulate the immune response. Here we show that cyclical hydrostatic pressure, similar to that experienced by immune cells in the lung, initiates an inflammatory response via the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1. Mice lacking PIEZO1 in innate immune cells showed ablated pulmonary inflammation in the context of bacterial infection or fibrotic autoinflammation. Our results reveal an environmental sensory axis that stimulates innate immune cells to mount an inflammatory response, and demonstrate a physiological role for PIEZO1 and mechanosensation in immunity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Angel G Solis, Piotr Bielecki, Holly R Steach, Lokesh Sharma, Christian C D Harman, Sanguk Yun, Marcel R de Zoete, James N Warnock, S D Filip To, Autumn G York, Matthias Mack, Martin A Schwartz, Charles S Dela Cruz, Noah W Palm, Ruaidhrí Jackson, Richard A Flavell<br><b>Journal:</b> Nature<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1476-4687<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 24.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 16.345<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435009">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Comparative Genomics for the Elucidation of Multidrug Resistance in Candida lusitaniae.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Multidrug resistance (MDR) has emerged in hospitals due to the use of several agents administered in combination or sequentially to the same individual.

One of the components of this system is Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes and/or endogenous molecules. Nonetheless, under certain conditions, these TLRs become hypofunctional or hyperfunctional, thus leading to a disease-like condition because their normal activity is compromised. In this regard, various small-molecule drugs and recombinant therapeutic proteins have been developed to treat the relevant diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and allergy. Some drugs for these diseases have been clinically approved; however, their efficacy can be enhanced by conventional or targeted drug delivery systems. Certain delivery vehicles such as liposomes, hydrogels, nanoparticles, dendrimers, or cyclodextrins can be employed to enhance the targeted drug delivery. This review summarizes the TLR signaling pathway, associated diseases and their treatments, and the ways to efficiently deliver the drugs to a target site.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Nasir Javaid, Farzana Yasmeen, Sangdun Choi<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmaceutics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1999-4923<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.74<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.091<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480568">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> None<br><b>Abstract:</b> The past decade has seen an increase in aspergillosis in humans and animals due to <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Jessica J Talbot, Jens C Frisvad, Jacques F Meis, Ferry Hagen, Paul E Verweij, David E Hibbs, Felcia Lai, Paul W Groundwater, Robert A Samson, Sarah E Kidd, Vanessa R Barrs, Jos Houbraken<br><b>Journal:</b> Antimicrob.

Early detection of this condition speeds up the establishment of appropriate treatment and increases the patient's life expectancy. Newborn screening for SCID started in January 2017 in Catalonia, the first Spanish and European region to universally include this testing. The results obtained in the first 2 years of experience are evaluated here. All babies born between January 2017 and December 2018 were screened. TREC quantification in DBS (1.5 mm diameter) was performed with the Enlite Neonatal TREC kit from PerkinElmer (Turku, Finland).

Initially, TGFβ is a tumor suppressor, but in advanced metastatic disease it switches to being a tumor promoter. TGFBR2 may play a critical role in this collaboration, as its expression is driven by NFκB and it is the primary receptor for TGFβ. We have previously reported that the cardenolide drug digitoxin blocks TNFα/NFκB-driven proinflammatory signaling. We therefore hypothesized that digitoxin might break the collaborative process between NFκB and TGFβ by also inhibiting expression of TGFBR2.

Consequently, our ability to use ultrasound energy at a given intensity unlocks the opportunity to use the ultrasound for therapeutic applications. Indeed, in the last decade ultrasound-based therapies have emerged with promising treatment modalities for several medical conditions.

The lung as a target also offers many advantages over other routers, such as large surface area, noninvasive, quick therapeutic onset, and avoiding first-pass metabolism. However, nanoparticles smaller than 0.26 µm typically escape phagocytosis and remain in the alveoli for a long time, leading to particle accumulation and invoking tissue responses. It is imperative to understand the behavior and fates of inhaled nanoparticles in the alveoli to reliably assess therapeutic outcomes of nanomedicines or health risk of environmental toxins. The objective of this study is to numerically investigate nanoparticle deposition in a duct-alveolar model with varying sizes of inter-alveolar septal apertures (pores). A discrete phase Lagrangian model was implemented to track nanoparticle trajectories under the influence of rhythmic wall expansion and contraction. Both temporal and spatial dosimetry in the alveoli were computed. Wall motions are essential for nanoparticles to penetrate the acinar region and deposit in the alveoli. The level of aerosol irreversibility (i.e., mixing of inhaled nanoparticles with residual air in the alveolar airspace) is determined by the particle diffusivity, which in turn, dictates the fraction of particles being exhaled out. When deposition in the upper airways was not considered, high alveolar deposition rates (74-95%) were predicted for all nanoparticles considered (1-1000 nm), which were released into the alveoli at the beginning of the inhalation. The pore size notably affects the deposition pattern of inhaled nanoparticles but exerts a low impact upon the total deposition fractions. This finding indicates that consistent pulmonary doses of nanomedicine are possible in emphysema patients if breathing maneuver with the same tidal volume can be performed.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Jinxiang Xi, Mohamed Talaat<br><b>Journal:</b> Nanomaterials (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2079-4991<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.08<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.896<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382669">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Human Antimicrobial Peptides as Therapeutics for Viral Infections.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Successful in vivo infection following pathogen entry requires the evasion and subversion of multiple immunological barriers.

The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the 100 most-cited research articles (T100) published on prenatal diagnosis.
METHODS: The Web of Science (WOS) database was searched for papers on prenatal diagnosis published between 1900 and 2018. The 100 most-cited original articles and reviews were recorded. Each eligible paper was reviewed for authors, journal name, year of publication, country, institution, total citations, citation density, H-index, research field, article type, and keywords.
RESULTS: The T100 were published between 1972 and 2015 with a mean of 332.7 citations per paper (range: 196-1254). Most of the T100 were published between 1990 and 2005, in 35 journals led by New England Journal of Medicine (n = 14) followed by Lancet (n = 10), and Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (n = 8). Studies on method application, which promotes field development, were the majority article type. The team of Lo YM featured prominently in the field, and the United States of America, United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, China were the leading countries/regions. Frequency of cooperation was also highest among these 3 regions. Hierarchical cluster analysis produced 4 groups of keywords.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides a historical perspective on scientific progress in prenatal diagnosis and may assist clinicians and researchers in assessing the quality of research over the past 50 years. It also provides concise information to guide future research.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Meilian Zhang, Yu Zhou, Yanfang Lu, Suhui He, Min Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Medicine (Baltimore)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1536-5964<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567987">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Neutrophil Extracellular Traps: Current Perspectives in the Eye.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been the subject of research in the field of innate immunity since their first description more than a decade ago. Neutrophils are the first cells recruited at sites of inflammation, where they perform their specific functions, including the release of NETs, which consist of web-like structures composed of granule proteins bound to decondensed chromatin fibres. This process has aroused interest, as it contributes to understanding how pathogenic microorganisms are contained, but they are also associated with pathophysiological processes of a wide range of diseases. Currently, there are growing reports of new molecules involved in the formation and release of NETs. However, whether the release of NETs contributes to eye diseases remains unclear. For this reason, the overall aim of this review is to gather current data of recent research in the ophthalmology field, where there is still much to discover.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Gibrán Alejandro Estúa-Acosta, Rocío Zamora-Ortiz, Beatriz Buentello-Volante, Mariana García-Mejía, Yonathan Garfias<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461831">Link</a></b><br><br><br><a name="companies"></a><h2>Companies</h2> <br><br><b>Company Name:</b> CRISPR Therapeutics<br><b>Overview:</b> CRISPR Therapeutics is a leading gene-editing company focused on the development of transformative medicines using its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform.

In some embodiments, the HBV RNAi agent comprises a sense and an anti-sense strand, each strand being an 18-mer and the strands together forming a blunt-ended duplex, wherein the 3' end of at least one strand terminates in a phosphate or modified internucleoside linker and further comprises, in 5' to 3' order: a spacer; a second phosphate or modified internucleoside linker; and a 3' end cap. In some embodiments, the 3' end of both the sense and anti-sense strand further comprise, in 5' to 3' order: a spacer; a second phosphate or modified internucleoside linker; and a 3' end cap. The two strands can have the same or different spacers, phosphates or modified internucleoside linkers, and/or 3' end caps. The strands can be ribonucleotides, or, optionally, one or more nucleotide can be modified or substituted. Optionally, at least one nucleotide comprises a modified internucleoside linker. Optionally, the RNAi agent can be modified on one or both 5' end. Optionally, the sense strand can comprise a 5' end cap which reduces the amount of the RNA interference mediated by this strand. Optionally, the RNAi agent is attached to a ligand. This format can be used to devise RNAi agents to a variety of different targets and sequences. The disclosure also relates to processes for making such compositions, and methods and uses of such compositions, e.g., to mediate RNA interference.
