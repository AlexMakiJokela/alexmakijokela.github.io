We assessed safety and tolerability of rAAV1-PG9DP, a recombinant AAV1 vector encoding the gene for PG9, a broadly neutralising antibody against HIV.
METHODS: This first-in-human, proof-of-concept, double-blind, phase 1, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial was done at one clinical research centre in the UK. Healthy men aged 18-45 years without HIV infection were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular injection with rAAV1-PG9DP or placebo in the deltoid or quadriceps in one of four dose-escalating cohorts (group A, 4 × 10
FINDINGS: Between Jan 30, 2014, and Feb 28, 2017, 111 volunteers were screened for eligibility. 21 volunteers were eligible and provided consent, and all 21 completed 48 weeks of follow-up. Reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate and resolved without intervention. No probably or definitely related adverse events or serious adverse events were recorded. We detected PG9 by HIV neutralisation in the serum of four volunteers, and by RT-PCR in muscle biopsy samples from four volunteers. We did not detect PG9 by ELISA in serum. PG9 anti-drug antibody was present in ten volunteers in the higher dose groups. Both anti-AAV1 antibodies and AAV1-specific T-cell responses were detected.
INTERPRETATION: Future studies should explore higher doses of AAV, alternative AAV serotypes and gene expression cassettes, or other broadly neutralising HIV antibodies.

A promising strategy is CRISPR-Cas9-mediated precise insertion of F8 in hepatocytes at highly expressed gene loci, such as albumin (Alb). Unfortunately, the precise in vivo integration efficiency of a long insert is very low (~ 0.1%).
RESULTS: We report that the use of a double-cut donor leads to a 10- to 20-fold increase in liver editing efficiency, thereby completely reconstituting serum F8 activity in a mouse model of hemophilia A after hydrodynamic injection of Cas9-sgAlb and B domain-deleted (BDD) F8 donor plasmids. We find that the integration of a double-cut donor at the Alb locus in mouse liver is mainly through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated knock-in. We then target BDDF8 to multiple sites on introns 11 and 13 and find that NHEJ-mediated insertion of BDDF8 restores hemostasis. Finally, using 3 AAV8 vectors to deliver genome editing components, including Cas9, sgRNA, and BDDF8 donor, we observe the same therapeutic effects. A follow-up of 100 mice over 1 year shows no adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings lay the foundation for curing hemophilia A by NHEJ knock-in of BDDF8 at Alb introns after AAV-mediated delivery of editing components.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Jian-Ping Zhang, Xin-Xin Cheng, Mei Zhao, Guo-Hua Li, Jing Xu, Feng Zhang, Meng-Di Yin, Fei-Ying Meng, Xin-Yue Dai, Ya-Wen Fu, Zhi-Xue Yang, Cameron Arakaki, Ruijun Jeanna Su, Wei Wen, Wen-Tian Wang, Wanqiu Chen, Hannah Choi, Charles Wang, Guangping Gao, Lei Zhang, Tao Cheng, Xiao-Bing Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Genome Biol.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1474-760X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 12.16<br><b>SJR:</b> 9.867<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31843008">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Rescue of spinal muscular atrophy mouse models with AAV9-Exon-specific U1 snRNA.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Spinal Muscular Atrophy results from loss-of-function mutations in SMN1 but correcting aberrant splicing of SMN2 offers hope of a cure. However, current splice therapy requires repeated infusions and is expensive. We previously rescued SMA mice by promoting the inclusion of a defective exon in SMN2 with germline expression of Exon-Specific U1 snRNAs (ExspeU1). Here we tested viral delivery of SMN2 ExspeU1s encoded by adeno-associated virus AAV9. Strikingly the virus increased SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and SMN protein levels and rescued the phenotype of mild and severe SMA mice. In the severe mouse, the treatment improved the neuromuscular function and increased the life span from 10 to 219 days. ExspeU1 expression persisted for 1 month and was effective at around one five-hundredth of the concentration of the endogenous U1snRNA. RNA-seq analysis revealed our potential drug rescues aberrant SMA expression and splicing profiles, which are mostly related to DNA damage, cell-cycle control and acute phase response. Vastly overexpressing ExspeU1 more than 100-fold above the therapeutic level in human cells did not significantly alter global gene expression or splicing. These results indicate that AAV-mediated delivery of a modified U1snRNP particle may be a novel therapeutic option against SMA.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Irving Donadon, Erica Bussani, Federico Riccardi, Danilo Licastro, Giulia Romano, Giulia Pianigiani, Mirko Pinotti, Pavlina Konstantinova, Melvin Evers, Shuo Lin, Markus A Rüegg, Franco Pagani<br><b>Journal:</b> Nucleic Acids Res.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1362-4962<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.14<br><b>SJR:</b> 8.636<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127278">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hemophilia A and B: molecular and clinical similarities and differences.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Giancarlo Castaman, Davide Matino<br><b>Journal:</b> Haematologica<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1592-8721<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.077<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399527">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> CRISPR to fix bad blood: a new tool in basic and clinical hematology.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in genome engineering in the last decade, particularly in the development of programmable nucleases, have made it possible to edit the genomes of most cell types precisely and efficiently.

In this review, we focus on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the context of hematologic diseases and appraise the major achievements and challenges in this rapidly moving field to gain a clearer perspective on the potential of this technology to move from the laboratory to the clinic. Accordingly, we discuss data from studies editing hematopoietic cells to understand and model blood diseases, and to develop novel therapies for hematologic malignancies. We provide an overview of the applications of gene editing in experimental, preclinical and clinical hematology including interrogation of gene function, target identification and drug discovery and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell engineering.

Liver transplantation, surgical resection, trans-arterial chemoembolization, and radio frequency ablation are effective strategies to treat early stage HCC. Unfortunately, HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and there are not many treatment options for late stage HCC. First-line therapy for late stage HCC includes sorafenib and lenvatinib. However, these treatments provide only an approximate three month increase in survival. Besides, they cannot specifically target cancer cells that lead to a wide array of side effects. Patients on these drugs develop resistance within a few months and have to rely on second-line therapy that includes regorafenib, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and cabometyx. These disadvantages make gene therapy approach to treat HCC an attractive option. The two important questions that researchers have been trying to answer in the last 2-3 decades are what genes should be targeted and what delivery systems should be used. The objective of this review is to analyze the changing landscape of HCC gene therapy, with a focus on these two questions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Saranya Chidambaranathan Reghupaty, Devanand Sarkar<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancers (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6694<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.37<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.142<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466358">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Computational Methods for Identifying Similar Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Although our knowledge of human diseases has increased dramatically, the molecular basis, phenotypic traits, and therapeutic targets of most diseases still remain unclear. An increasing number of studies have observed that similar diseases often are caused by similar molecules, can be diagnosed by similar markers or phenotypes, or can be cured by similar drugs. Thus, the identification of diseases similar to known ones has attracted considerable attention worldwide. To this end, the associations between diseases at the molecular, phenotypic, and taxonomic levels were used to measure the pairwise similarity in diseases. The corresponding performance assessment strategies for these methods involving the terms "category-based," "simulated-patient-based," and "benchmark-data-based" were thus further emphasized. Then, frequently used methods were evaluated using a benchmark-data-based strategy. To facilitate the assessment of disease similarity scores, researchers have designed dozens of tools that implement these methods for calculating disease similarity. Currently, disease similarity has been advantageous in predicting noncoding RNA (ncRNA) function and therapeutic drugs for diseases. In this article, we review disease similarity methods, evaluation strategies, tools, and their applications in the biomedical community. We further evaluate the performance of these methods and discuss the current limitations and future trends for calculating disease similarity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Liang Cheng, Hengqiang Zhao, Pingping Wang, Wenyang Zhou, Meng Luo, Tianxin Li, Junwei Han, Shulin Liu, Qinghua Jiang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Nucleic Acids<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2162-2531<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.011<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678735">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> ssODN-Mediated In-Frame Deletion with CRISPR/Cas9 Restores FVIII Function in Hemophilia A-Patient-Derived iPSCs and ECs.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Given that the cDNA of F8 is too large to be packaged into adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids, gene transfer of some versions of B-domain-deleted F8 (BDD-F8) for hemophilia A (HA) treatment has been attempted with promising results. Here, we describe an efficient gene correction via single-stranded-oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)-mediated in-frame deletion within the B domain of F8 with CRISPR/Cas9 in HA-patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (HA-iPSCs). The expression and activity of FVIII was restored in corrected HA-iPSC-derived induced endothelial progenitor cells (C-iEPCs) in vitro and in vivo. The bleeding phenotype was rescued in HA mice after C-iEPC infusion. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for in situ gene correction via introduction of a tiny deletion using ssODN and CRISPR/Cas9 to reframe the F8 transcript and restore FVIII function in HA-iPSC-derived EPCs with potential clinical impact in HA gene therapy. For the first time, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo the FVIII function that is encoded by the endogenous F8 gene with a partially deleted B domain.

In particular, hemophilia A can be considered an ideal target for gene modification via engineered nucleases because it is a monogenic disease caused by a mutation in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), and a mild restoration of FVIII levels in plasma can prevent disease symptoms in patients with severe hemophilia A. In this study, we describe a universal genome correction strategy to restore FVIII expression in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient with hemophilia A by the human elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α)-mediated normal FVIII gene expression in the FVIII locus of the patient. We used the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) system to insert the B-domain deleted from the FVIII gene with the human EF1α promoter. After gene targeting, the FVIII gene was correctly inserted into iPSC lines at a high frequency (81.81%), and these cell lines retained pluripotency after knock-in and neomycin resistance cassette removal. More importantly, we confirmed that endothelial cells from the gene-corrected iPSCs could generate functionally active FVIII protein from the inserted FVIII gene. This is the first demonstration that the FVIII locus is a suitable site for integration of the normal FVIII gene and can restore FVIII expression by the EF1α promoter in endothelial cells differentiated from the hemophilia A patient-derived gene-corrected iPSCs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Jin Jea Sung, Chul-Yong Park, Joong Woo Leem, Myung Soo Cho, Dong-Wook Kim<br><b>Journal:</b> Exp.

Among them, the HBB IVS2-654 (C > T) mutation, which is in the intron, creates an aberrant splicing site. Bone marrow transplantation for curing β-thalassaemia is limited due to the lack of matched donors. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), as a widely used tool for gene editing, is able to target specific sequence and create double-strand break (DSB), which can be combined with the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) to correct mutations. In this study, according to two different strategies, the HBB IVS2-654 mutation was seamlessly corrected in iPSCs by CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN. To reduce the occurrence of secondary cleavage, a more efficient strategy was adopted. The corrected iPSCs kept pluripotency and genome stability. Moreover, they could differentiate normally. Through CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN, our study provides improved strategies for gene correction of β-Thalassaemia, and the expression of the HBB gene can be restored, which can be used for gene therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Xiong, Yingjun Xie, Yi Yang, Yanting Xue, Ding Wang, Shouheng Lin, Diyu Chen, Dian Lu, Lina He, Bing Song, Yinghong Yang, Xiaofang Sun<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

Here, we focus on the molecular mechanisms and determinants underlying innovative approaches acting at DNA, mRNA and protein levels in inherited coagulation factor deficiencies, and in particular on: (i) gene editing approaches, which have permitted intervention at the DNA level through the specific recognition, cleavage, repair/correction or activation of target sequences, even in mutated gene contexts; (ii) the rescue of altered pre-mRNA processing through the engineering of key spliceosome components able to promote correct exon recognition and, in turn, the synthesis and secretion of functional factors, as well as the effects on the splicing of missense changes affecting exonic splicing elements; this section includes antisense oligonucleotide- or siRNA-mediated approaches to down-regulate target genes; (iii) the rescue of protein synthesis/function through the induction of ribosome readthrough targeting nonsense variants or the correction of folding defects caused by amino acid substitutions.

Current and emerging treatments such as FVIII protein injection and gene therapies via AAV-delivered F8 transgene in an episome are costly and nonpermanent. Here, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo genome editing method, combined with non-homologous end joining, enabling permanent chromosomal integration of a modified human B domain deleted-F8 (BDD-F8) at the albumin (Alb) locus in liver cells. To test the approach in mice, C57BL/6 mice received tail vein injections of two vectors, AAV8-SaCas9-gRNA, targeting Alb intron 13, and AAV8-BDD-F8. This resulted in BDD-F8 insertion at the Alb locus and FVIII protein expression in the liver of vector-, but not vehicle-, treated mice. Using this approach in hemophilic mice, BDD-F8 was expressed in liver cells as functional human FVIII, leading to increased plasma levels of FVIII and restoration of blood clotting properties in a dose-dependent manor for at least 7 months, with no detectable liver toxicity or meaningful off-target effects. Based on these findings, our BDD-F8 genome editing approach may offer an efficacious, long-term and safe treatment for patients with hemophilia A.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Hainan Chen, Mi Shi, Avital Gilam, Qi Zheng, Yin Zhang, Ivka Afrikanova, Jinling Li, Zoya Gluzman, Ruhong Jiang, Ling-Jie Kong, Ruby Yanru Chen-Tsai<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31727959">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hemophilia A and B mice, but not VWF<br><b>Abstract:</b> While joint damage is the primary co-morbidity of hemophilia, osteoporosis and osteopenia are also observed.

However, allogeneic cell therapy is limited by host patient immunologic competence and inconsistent performance due to cell delivery methods. To address allogeneic cell therapy limitations, this study developed a new allogeneic stem cell sheet using human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) that present low antigenicity (i.e., major histocompatibility complex, MHC). Optimal conditions including cell density, passage number, and culture time were examined to fabricate reliable hUC-MSC sheets. MHC II antigens correlated to alloimmune rejection were barely expressed in hUC-MSC sheets compared to other comparator MSC sheets (hBMSC and hADSC). hUC-MSC sheets easily graft spontaneously onto subcutaneous tissue in immune-deficient mice within 10 minutes of placement. No sutures are required to secure sheets to tissue because sheet extracellular matrix (ECM) actively facilitates cell-target tissue adhesion. At 10 days post-transplantation, hUC-MSC sheets remain on ectopic target tissue sites and exhibit new blood vessel formation. Furthermore, implanted hUC-MSC sheets secrete human HGF continuously to the murine target tissue. hUC-MSC sheets described here should provide new insights for improving allogenic cell-based therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Kyungsook Kim, Sophia Bou-Ghannam, Hallie Thorp, David W Grainger, Teruo Okano<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595012">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Production of adeno-associated virus vectors for in vitro and in vivo applications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Delivering and expressing a gene of interest in cells or living animals has become a pivotal technique in biomedical research and gene therapy.

A humanised mouse model of β-thalassemia was used, in which heterozygous animals are anaemic with splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Intrahepatic in utero injections of a β globin-expressing lentiviral vector (GLOBE), were performed in fetuses at E13.5 of gestation. We analysed animals at 12 and 32 weeks of age, for vector copy number in bone marrow, peripheral blood liver and spleen and we performed integration site analysis. Compared to noninjected heterozygous animals IUGT normalised blood haemoglobin levels and spleen weight. Integration site analysis showed polyclonality. The left ventricular ejection fraction measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in treated heterozygous animals was similar to that of normal non-β-thalassemic mice but significantly higher than untreated heterozygous thalassemia mice suggesting that IUGT ameliorated poor cardiac function.

Gene therapy can overcome these barriers through continuous delivery of therapeutic gene products to the target tissue. In particular, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are potential candidates for use in chronic SCI, considering their safety and stable gene expression in vivo. Given that different AAV serotypes display different cellular tropisms, it is extremely important to select an optimal serotype for establishing a gene transfer system during the chronic phase of SCI. Therefore, we generated multiple AAV serotypes expressing ffLuc-cp156, a fusion protein of firefly luciferase and Venus, a variant of yellow fluorescent protein with fast and efficient maturation, as a reporter, and we performed intraparenchymal injection in a chronic SCI mouse model. Among the various serotypes tested, AAVrh10 displayed the highest photon count on bioluminescence imaging. Immunohistological analysis revealed that AAVrh10 showed favourable tropism for neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Additionally, with AAVrh10, the area expressing Venus was larger in the injury epicentre and extended to the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity was significantly higher with AAVrh10 than with the other vectors. These results indicate that AAVrh10 may be an appropriate serotype for gene delivery to the chronically injured spinal cord. This promising tool may be applied for research and development related to the treatment of chronic SCI.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Yutaka Hoshino, Kenji Nishide, Narihito Nagoshi, Shinsuke Shibata, Nobuko Moritoki, Kota Kojima, Osahiko Tsuji, Morio Matsumoto, Jun Kohyama, Masaya Nakamura, Hideyuki Okano<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285460">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> First Report of Prevalence of Blood-Borne Viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV, HTLV-1 and Parvovirus B19) Among Hemophilia Patients in Afghanistan.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Blood-borne viruses including Hepatitis B and C, HIV, HTLV-1 and parvovirus B19 are still a factor of concern, especially for hemophilia patients. Although the safety of the blood supply continues to improve worldwide, the blood supply system in Afghanistan was damaged by many years of conflict and political instability. To date, there are few studies focused on the prevalence of blood-borne viruses in hemophilia patients. This study is first to investigate the prevalence of five blood-borne viruses in Afghanistan hemophilia patients in four cities including Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalal Abad. A total of 80 hemophilia male patients were screening for the presence of five transfusion-transmitted viruses using ELISA and PCR. Data obtained showed 2.5% seropositivity for HBV, 8.75% seropositivity for HCV, and 91.25% seropositivity for parvovirus B19. None of the patients were positive for HIV and HTLV-1 and the prevalence of HCV was higher in older patients rather than younger patients. This finding, the first to report in Afghanistan, shows a high prevalence of parvovirus B19 in Afghanistan hemophilia patients and implementation of highly sensitive screening is necessary.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Sayed Hamid Mousavi, Niloofar Khairkhah, Tina Delsouz Bahri, Ali Anvar, Alireza Azizi Saraji, Bita Behnava, Seyed Moayed Alavian, Ali Namvar<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086199">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Modeling blood diseases with human induced pluripotent stem cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are derived from somatic cells through a reprogramming process, which converts them to a pluripotent state, akin to that of embryonic stem cells.

The burden of this disease in Portugal remains unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the annualized cost and health burden of haemophilia A in Portugal.
METHODS: Data were extracted from a Portuguese expert panel, from official data and national literature. Annual costs were calculated from the perspective of the society including direct and indirect costs. Unitary costs were extracted from 2017 national official sources and are expressed in euros. Health burden was expressed in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) based on incidence and quality of life questionnaires. Estimates are presented for the overall population and stratified by severity, age group (< 18 years vs. adults) and inhibitor status.
RESULTS: The yearly average cost per patient is estimated to range from €39,654/patient without inhibitors and €302,189/patient with inhibitors, representing a 7.6 fold difference. Amongst patients without inhibitors, the annual average cost was €401 in mild, €5327 in moderate and €85,805 in severe disease. Average cost per child and adult is €72,287 and €51,737, respectively. Direct costs represent approximately 95% of all costs, of which almost the totality accounts for clotting factor replacement therapy and bypassing agents. The total annual cost of haemophilia A for the Portuguese society was estimated to be €42,66 million, one third of which was related to the treatment of patients with inhibitors. It is estimated that haemophilia A is responsible for 3878 DALYs in Portugal (497 DALYs in mild, 524 DALYs in moderate, 2031 DALYs in severe patients without inhibitors and 784 DALYs in patients with inhibitors) for the cohort of 2017 (750 patients) or 5.2 DALY/patient during lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite being rare, the economic and health burden of haemophilia A is remarkable. The main cost driver is clotting factor replacement therapy. Moreover, haemophilia A is more costly in children than in adults and rises exponentially with disease severity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Andreia Café, Manuela Carvalho, Miguel Crato, Miguel Faria, Paula Kjollerstrom, Cristina Oliveira, Patrícia R Pinto, Ramón Salvado, Alexandra Aires Dos Santos, Catarina Silva<br><b>Journal:</b> Orphanet J Rare Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1750-1172<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.589<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484564">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors in Neuroscience Research.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) are increasingly useful preclinical tools in neuroscience research studies for interrogating cellular and neurocircuit functions and mapping brain connectivity.

Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) have been frequently observed, and long-term AAV-mediated delivery has been inconsistent. Here, we investigated different AAV vector strategies and delivery schemes to rhesus monkeys using the rhesus monkey mAb 4L6. We compared 4L6 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) delivery using the AAV1 versus the AAV8 serotype with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the use of a muscle-specific versus a liver-specific promoter. Long-term expression levels of 4L6 IgG1 following AAV8-mediated gene transfer were comparable to those following AAV1-mediated gene transfer. AAV1-mediated gene transfer, using a muscle-specific promoter, showed robust ADAs and transiently low 4L6 IgG1 levels that ultimately declined to below detectable levels. Intravenous AAV8-mediated gene transfer, using a liver-specific promoter, also resulted in low levels of delivered 4L6 IgG1, but those low levels were maintained in the absence of any detectable ADAs. Booster injections using AAV1-CMV allowed for increased 4L6 IgG1 serum levels in animals that were primed with AAV8 but not with AAV1. Our results suggest that liver-directed expression may help to limit ADAs and that re-administration of AAV of a different serotype can result in successful long-term delivery of an immunogenic antibody.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-31<br><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian P Fuchs, José M Martinez-Navio, Eva G Rakasz, Guangping Gao, Ronald C Desrosiers<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2329-0501<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.64<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.487<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31890736">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Flow-Cytometry Platform for Intracellular Detection of FVIII in Blood Cells: A New Tool to Assess Gene Therapy Efficiency for Hemophilia A.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Detection of factor VIII (FVIII) in cells by flow cytometry is controversial, and no monoclonal fluorescent antibody is commercially available. In this study, we optimized such an assay and successfully used it as a platform to study the functional properties of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)-FVIII lentiviral vector-transduced cells by directly visualizing FVIII in cells after different gene transfer conditions. We could measure cellular stress parameters after transduction by correlating gene expression and protein accumulation data. Flow cytometry performed on transduced cell lines showed that increasing MOI rates resulted in increased protein levels, plateauing after an MOI of 30. We speculated that, at higher MOI, FVIII production could be impaired by a limiting factor required for proper folding. To test this hypothesis, we interfered with the unfolded protein response by blocking proteasomal degradation and measured the accumulation of intracellular misfolded protein. Interestingly, at higher MOIs the cells displayed signs of toxicity with reactive oxygen species accumulation. This suggests the need for identifying a safe window of transduction dose to avoid consequent cell toxicity. Herein, we show that our flow cytometry platform for intracytoplasmic FVIII protein detection is a reliable method for optimizing gene therapy protocols in hemophilia A by shedding light on the functional status of cells after gene transfer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Elnaggar, Anjud Al-Mohannadi, Dhanya Kizhakayil, Christophe Michel Raynaud, Sharefa Al-Mannai, Giusy Gentilcore, Igor Pavlovski, Abbirami Sathappan, Nicholas Van Panhuys, Chiara Borsotti, Antonia Follenzi, Jean-Charles Grivel, Sara Deola<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2329-0501<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.64<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.487<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31886317">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunoresponse to Gene-Modified Hematopoietic Stem Cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene transfer to and correction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are ideal strategies to cure a number of congenital and acquired disorders.

Given that there are multiple clinical trials completed and ongoing in this field, it is important to review the clinical evidence, particularly as a range of AAV-vector serotypes including AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, and AAV10 have been tested. Although there have been a number of successful trials, the development of two investigational AAV vectors for hemophilia B has been discontinued because they did not meet efficacy and/or safety expectations. Whether this difference between success and failure of gene transfer approaches reflects capsid choice, vector design, manufacturing system, or other variables is a question of great interest.

In other peripheral tissues such as the skeletal muscle, anti-transgene immune response can result in partial or complete clearance of the transduced fibers. Here, we characterized liver-induced transgene tolerance after simultaneous transduction of liver and muscle. A clinically relevant transgene, α-sarcoglycan, mutated in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D, was fused with the SIINFEKL epitope (hSGCA-SIIN) and expressed with adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV-hSGCA-SIIN). Intramuscular delivery of AAV-hSGCA-SIIN resulted in a strong inflammatory response, which could be prevented and reversed by concomitant liver expression of the same antigen. Regulatory T cells and upregulation of checkpoint inhibitor receptors were required to establish and maintain liver-mediated peripheral tolerance.

Currently, we have reached the safe limits of AAV vector dose, beyond which damaging inflammatory responses are seen. To improve the efficacy of AAV transduction, we treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, primate retinal pigment epithelial cells, and human retinal explants with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 1 h prior to transduction with an AAV2 vector encoding GFP driven by a ubiquitous CAG promoter. This led to a consistent increase in GFP expression, up to 3-fold, compared with vector alone. Comparing subretinal injections of AAV2.CAG.GFP vector alone versus co-injection with 18.75 μM HCQ in paired eyes in mice, mean GFP expression was 4.6-fold higher in retinae co-treated with HCQ without retinal toxicity. A comparative 5.9-fold effect was seen with an AAV8(Y733F).GRK1.GFP vector containing the photoreceptor-specific rhodopsin kinase promoter.

Currently ~ 3000 adult and ~ 30 pluripotent stem cell-based, interventional clinical trials are ongoing worldwide, and numbers are increasing continuously. Although stem cells are promising cell sources to treat a wide range of human diseases, there are also concerns regarding potential risks associated with their clinical use, including genomic instability and tumorigenesis concerns. Thus, a deeper understanding of the factors and molecular mechanisms contributing to stem cell genome stability are a prerequisite to harnessing their therapeutic potential for degenerative diseases. Chemical and physical factors are known to influence the stability of stem cell genomes, together with random mutations and Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that accumulated in cultured human stem cells. Here we review the activity of endogenous transposable elements (TEs) in human multipotent and pluripotent stem cells, and the consequences of their mobility for genomic integrity and host gene expression. We describe transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms antagonizing the spread of TEs in the human genome, and highlight those that are more prevalent in multipotent and pluripotent stem cells. Notably, TEs do not only represent a source of mutations/CNVs in genomes, but are also often harnessed as tools to engineer the stem cell genome; thus, we also describe and discuss the most widely applied transposon-based tools and highlight the most relevant areas of their biomedical applications in stem cells. Taken together, this review will contribute to the assessment of the risk that endogenous TE activity and the application of genetically engineered TEs constitute for the biosafety of stem cells to be used for substitutive and regenerative cell therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Gerald G Schumann, Nina V Fuchs, Pablo Tristán-Ramos, Attila Sebe, Zoltán Ivics, Sara R Heras<br><b>Journal:</b> Mob DNA<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1759-8753<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.50<br><b>SJR:</b> 4.407<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899334">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Identification of Novel Microsatellite Markers Flanking the <br><b>Abstract:</b> Preimplantation genetic testing for the monogenic disorder (PGT-M) spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is significantly improved by supplementation of <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Mingjue Zhao, Mulias Lian, Felicia S H Cheah, Arnold S C Tan, Anupriya Agarwal, Samuel S Chong<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-8021<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.888<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781167">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Development and Clinical Translation of Approved Gene Therapy Products for Genetic Disorders.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The field of gene therapy is striving more than ever to define a path to the clinic and the market.

AIM: To assess available evidence of clinical risks and societal/economic impacts of disease in adult patients with mild HA using a systematic literature review.
METHODS: Prespecified study selection criteria were applied in a comprehensive literature search. Included studies varied in design and reported outcomes of interest for adults (≥13 years of age) with mild HA.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies with a total of 3213 patients met eligibility criteria (published or presented in English, 1966-2017). Most studies were observational, and the outcomes reported were too sparse and dissimilar to support a formal meta-analysis. Mean annual bleeding rates ranged from 0.44 to 4.5 episodes per patient per year. Quality of life (QoL; SF-36 General Health) was impacted compared to healthy controls. Health care costs and productivity were seldom assessed and no robust comparisons to healthy controls were available.
CONCLUSION: Quantifying outcomes for adult patients with mild HA remains challenging, with estimates of key QoL and cost data often based on small data sets and without comparison to population norms. Therefore, the clinical impact of mild haemophilia may be under-represented and unmet needs may remain unaddressed. As paradigm-changing therapies for HA emerge, stronger knowledge of mild HA can guide the development of care options that minimize burden and enhance the QoL for this segment of the haemophilia community, and for the haemophilia community in totality.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Flora Peyvandi, Fatemeh Tavakkoli, Diana Frame, Jennifer Quinn, Benjamin Kim, Adebayo Lawal, Mimi C Lee, Wing Y Wong<br><b>Journal:</b> Haemophilia<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1365-2516<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.23<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.163<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294906">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> How to discuss gene therapy for haemophilia? A patient and physician perspective.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene therapy has the potential to revolutionise treatment for patients with haemophilia and is close to entering clinical practice. While factor concentrates have improved outcomes, individuals still face a lifetime of injections, pain, progressive joint damage, the potential for inhibitor development and impaired quality of life. Recently published studies in adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene therapy have demonstrated improvement in endogenous factor levels over sustained periods, significant reduction in annualised bleed rates, lower exogenous factor usage and thus far a positive safety profile. In making the shared decision to proceed with gene therapy for haemophilia, physicians should make it clear that research is ongoing and that there are remaining evidence gaps, such as long-term safety profiles and duration of treatment effect. The eligibility criteria for gene therapy trials mean that key patient groups may be excluded, eg children/adolescents, those with liver or kidney dysfunction and those with a prior history of factor inhibitors or pre-existing neutralising AAV antibodies. Gene therapy offers a life-changing opportunity for patients to reduce their bleeding risk while also reducing or abrogating the need for exogenous factor administration. Given the expanding evidence base, both physicians and patients will need sources of clear and reliable information to be able to discuss and judge the risks and benefits of treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Wolfgang Miesbach, Brian O'Mahony, Nigel S Key, Mike Makris<br><b>Journal:</b> Haemophilia<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1365-2516<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.23<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.163<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115117">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> From the voices of people with haemophilia A and their caregivers: Challenges with current treatment, their impact on quality of life and desired improvements in future therapies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Haemophilia A is a chronic disease requiring frequent intravenous infusions of recombinant factor VIII. Previous studies have shown that challenges associated with current treatments may have significant impacts on quality of life (QoL) that are as important as the health outcomes conferred by the therapy. Emerging therapeutic innovations offer the potential to mitigate treatment-related challenges, and it is therefore important to develop a better understanding of patient and caregiver experiences with existing haemophilia A treatments in order to characterize the full value of new treatments.
AIM: To gather firsthand perspectives from people with haemophilia A (PWHA) and caregivers on the challenges with current treatment, their impact on QoL and desired improvements in future therapies.
METHODS: Qualitative insights were gathered from 20 non-inhibitor PWHA or caregivers of PWHA across Canada through one-on-one interviews; insights were further explored through focus group sessions to uncover overarching themes and prioritize issues with current treatments.
RESULTS: PWHA and caregivers identified several challenges, including administration of intravenous infusions, coordination of treatment schedules and ensuring adequate medication and supplies. Participants described how these challenges impact psychosocial well-being, physical health, personal/social life and work. Alternate modes of administration and longer-lasting treatment effects were identified as desired improvements over current treatments.
CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the impact that existing haemophilia A treatments have on psychological well-being, employment opportunities and adherence to treatment regimens. These considerations may help to inform decision-making for policymakers and health systems around the true value of new therapies entering the haemophilia market.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Ryan E Wiley, Charles P Khoury, Adrian W K Snihur, Marni Williams, David Page, Nicole Graham, Lori Laudenbach, Cindy Milne-Wren, Jayson M Stoffman<br><b>Journal:</b> Haemophilia<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1365-2516<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.23<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.163<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016823">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Modulation of immune responses in lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Lentiviral vectors (LV) are widely used vehicles for gene transfer and therapy in pre-clinical animal models and clinical trials with promising safety and efficacy results.

Patients and methods: A retrospective safety assessment of both clinical trials and registries used to support licensure and postmarketing surveillance was performed. The rate of thrombosis was calculated in the 4 indicated disorders and an assessment of TE risk factors was conducted through a review of all narratives within those indications in the safety database.
Results: In clinical trials and registries used to support licensure and in postmarketing surveillance, the overall rate of thrombosis was 0.17% of 12,288 bleeding and surgical episodes. The specific risk by indication was 0.11% for CHwI, 0.82% for FVII deficiency, 0.19% for GT, and 1.77% for AH. The most common associated risk factor-"elderly" (29%), defined in the PI as age ≥65 years-was particularly prevalent in patients with AH. TE was also frequently reported with concomitant cardiac or vascular disease (18%) and use of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (18%).

In the phase 1/2 clinical studies, once-weekly subcutaneous administration of emicizumab has shown a favorable safety profile with encouraging efficacy in the patients with hemophilia A (PwHA) irrespective of the presence of anti-FVIII inhibitors. Moreover, in the following phase 3 studies, emicizumab treatment by once-weekly, bi-weekly or tetra-weekly administration have been still well-tolerated, but some thromboembolic events or thrombotic microangiopathy were observed associated with the concomitant use of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) for breakthrough bleeds. Since approved for routine prophylaxis in PwHA in the US, EU, and Japan, a compass on patient selection for emicizumab treatment and special considerations on the practical situations such as concomitant treatment by bypassing agents (BPAs) or clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) with less thrombotic risk, inhibitor eradication by immune tolerance induction (ITI) should be provided. There is no doubt that emicizumab is an alternate first-line therapy for any existing BPA as hemostatic treatment for PwHA with inhibitor, but we should be more cautious in combination with aPCC on breakthrough bleeds under emicizumab prophylaxis because of thrombotic risk. For severe PwHA without inhibitor, since most patients are under CFCs prophylaxis, switching from CFCs to emicizumab should be considered when the advantage of emicizumab prophylaxis surpasses that of CFCs prophylaxis from the viewpoint of hemostatic effect by treatment, physical activity according to the life stage, health condition of the joints, adherence and complication. There are pros and cons on the timing of introduction of emicizumab for cases scheduled to start ITI or cases of ongoing ITI. Introduction of emicizumab to previously untreated patients and nonsevere PwHA without inhibitor is also required to discuss in consideration of risk of inhibitor development and unforeseen safety issues.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Koji Yada, Keiji Nogami<br><b>Journal:</b> J Blood Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1179-2736<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.96<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.871<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308776">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Clade F AAVHSCs cross the blood brain barrier and transduce the central nervous system in addition to peripheral tissues following intravenous administration in nonhuman primates.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The biodistribution of AAVHSC7, AAVHSC15, and AAVHSC17 following systemic delivery was assessed in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Animals received a single intravenous (IV) injection of a self-complementary AAVHSC-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) vector and tissues were harvested at two weeks post-dose for anti-eGFP immunohistochemistry and vector genome analyses. IV delivery of AAVHSC vectors produced widespread distribution of eGFP staining in glial cells throughout the central nervous system, with the highest levels seen in the pons and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN). eGFP-positive neurons were also observed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems for all three AAVHSC vectors including brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with staining evident in neuronal cell bodies, axons and dendritic arborizations. Co-labeling of sections from brain, spinal cord, and DRG with anti-eGFP antibodies and cell-specific markers confirmed eGFP-staining in neurons and glia, including protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. For all capsids tested, 50 to 70% of glial cells (S100-β+) and on average 8% of neurons (NeuroTrace+) in the LGN were positive for eGFP expression. In the DRG, 45 to 62% of neurons and 8 to 12% of satellite cells were eGFP-positive for the capsids tested. eGFP staining was also observed in peripheral tissues with abundant staining in hepatocytes, skeletal- and cardio-myocytes and in acinar cells of the pancreas. Biodistribution of AAVHSC vector genomes in the central and peripheral organs generally correlated with eGFP staining and were highest in the liver for all AAVHSC vectors tested.

Our group recently established a hMSC-derived immortalized hepatocyte-like cell line (imHC) that demonstrates several liver-specific phenotypes. However, the ability of imHC to produce coagulation factors has not been characterized. Here, we examined the potential for imHC as a source of coagulation protein production by investigating the ability of imHC to produce human factor VII (FVII) using a lentiviral transduction system. Our results showed that imHC secreted a low amount of FVII (~22 ng/mL) into culture supernatant.

We demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that imHC produced FVII, albeit at a low level, indicating the unique characteristic of hepatocytes.

It results from repeated bleeding episodes in the joint and is characterized by synovial hypertrophy and cartilage and bony destruction. Hemophilic arthropathy assessment is a continually evolving process and is particularly challenging in children and young adults in whom joint disease may be missed or underestimated as obtaining serial "baseline" magnetic resonance imaging scans of multiple clinically asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic joints may be unjustifiable and cost-ineffective. Musculoskeletal ultrasound-particularly, point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasound-has emerged as a promising imaging modality for the early detection and management of hemophilic arthropathy, and for the evaluation of hemarthrosis and painful musculoskeletal episodes in patients with hemophilia. This review summarizes currently available data on the emerging role of this new imaging modality, its limitations, and gaps in knowledge. The review also raises unanswered questions, highlights the need for consolidated research efforts, and delineates future directions expected to advance this technology and optimize its use in this patient population.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Nihal Bakeer, Amy D Shapiro<br><b>Journal:</b> F1000Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2046-1402<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.64<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.235<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431824">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Surgical Risk on Patients with Coagulopathies: Guidelines on Hemophiliac Patients for Oro-Maxillofacial Surgery.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Haemophilia is a disease of genetic origin, which causes a defect in blood coagulation. Under normal conditions, in the case of leakage from the blood vessels, the blood forms a clot that reduces or blocks the bleeding. This process involves the activation of several plasma proteins in a cascade-like species. Two of these proteins, produced in the liver, factor VIII and factor IX, are deficient or present a functional defect in people with haemophilia. Because of this deficit, the haemophiliacs easily suffer external and internal bleeding. Surgical treatment of these patients is to be observed, and often their treatment is delayed due to unclear guidelines and risks in treating these patients. The aim is to provide clear guidelines in the case of surgical treatment of these patients.
METHODS: In this study, we have considered all the guidelines that refer to the gold-maxillofacial surgery, focusing on the literature of the last 10 years.
RESULTS: Surely, this collection of guidelines will favor the choice of the clinician towards safer and predictable protocols. This study does not want to create a guideline but evaluates the literature of the last 10 years, and highlights the latest for the treatment of these patients., with the aim of informing the pathology and at the same time making the surgical maneuvers safer.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the research of literature has produced few results, it was nevertheless possible to draw up a guideline thanks to additional information extrapolated from textbooks and other scientific articles. According to the guidelines, it is possible to proceed to the treatment of these patients, if with appropriate therapy in a safe and risk-free manner.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Luigi Laino, Marco Cicciù, Luca Fiorillo, Salvatore Crimi, Alberto Bianchi, Giulia Amoroso, Ines Paola Monte, Alan Scott Herford, Gabriele Cervino<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Environ Res Public Health<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1660-4601<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.62<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.818<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999657">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Clinical utility and impact of the use of the chromogenic vs one-stage factor activity assays in haemophilia A and B.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Treatment of haemophilia A/B patients comprises factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) concentrate replacement therapy, respectively. FVIII and FIX activity levels can be measured in clinical laboratories using one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based clotting or two-stage chromogenic factor activity assays. We discuss strengths and limitations of these assays, providing examples of clinical scenarios to highlight some of the challenges associated with their current use for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. Substantial inter-laboratory variability has been reported for one-stage assays when measuring the activity of factor replacement products due to the wide range of currently available aPTT reagents, calibration standards, factor-deficient plasmas, assay conditions and instruments. Chromogenic activity assays may avoid some limitations associated with one-stage assays, but their regulatory status, perceived higher cost, and lack of laboratory expertise may influence their use. Haemophilia management guidelines recommend the differential application of one or both assays for initial diagnosis and disease severity characterisation, post-infusion monitoring and replacement factor potency labelling. Efficient communication between clinical and laboratory staff is crucial to ensure application of the most appropriate assay to each clinical situation, correct interpretation of assay results and, ultimately, accurate diagnosis and optimal and safe treatment of haemophilia A or B patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Richard A Marlar, Karin Strandberg, Midori Shima, Dorothy M Adcock<br><b>Journal:</b> Eur.

Pioneering work by Doudna and Charpentier in 2012 resulted in the creation of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool on the basis of this concept. The aim of this was to create a rapid, efficient, and versatile genome-editing tool to facilitate genetic manipulation. The mechanism relies on two components: the RNA guide which acts as a sentinel and a Cas protein complex which functions as a highly precise molecular knife. The guide RNA can be modified to match a DNA sequence of interest in the cell and accordingly be used to rectify mutations that may otherwise cause disease. Within a few years following the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, its usage has become ubiquitous. Its influence extends into many fields of biological sciences from biotechnology and biochemistry to molecular biology and biomedical sciences. The following review aims at shedding some light on to the applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool in the field of biomedical sciences, particularly gene therapy.

Methods: A post hoc data analysis from the international, multicenter, phase 2/3 PROLONG-ATE study of rurioctocog alfa pegol in patients with severe HA (NCT01736475) determined annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) and rates of adverse events (AEs) in Korean patients treated in this study.
Results: All 10 enrolled Korean patients receiving rurioctocog alfa pegol (9 prophylaxis, 1 on-demand) completed the study [median (range) age, 28.0 (12-50) yr; weight, 64.8 (45-90) kg; 8 patients had ≥1 target joint at screening]. Median (range) ABR was 1.9 (0.0-14.5) for patients on prophylaxis and 62.2 for the patient receiving on-demand treatment. The hemostatic efficacy of rurioctocog alfa pegol was rated "excellent" or "good" and only single infusions were required per bleeding episode. ABRs improved in most patients compared with prestudy values. No dose adjustments were required for prophylaxis, and the dosing frequency was reduced in 8 patients, compared with their previous prophylaxis regimen. No serious AEs were reported; all 9 nonserious AEs (in 3 patients) were mild in severity and unrelated to the study treatment.
Conclusion: This post hoc analysis of a small group of Korean patients with severe HA indicated that rurioctocog alfa pegol was effective, and no serious AEs were observed.

In this regard, extended half-life (EHL) recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) and factor IX (rFIX) products promise optimal prophylaxis by decreasing the dose frequency, increasing the compliance, and improving the quality of life without compromising safety and efficacy. EHL products might lead to higher trough levels without increasing infusion frequency, or could facilitate the ability to maintain trough levels while reducing infusion frequency. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the rationale for developing EHL coagulation factors and their utility in the management of hemophilia, with special emphasis on optimal techniques for half-life extension and criteria for defining EHL coagulation factors, as well as indications, efficacy, and safety issues of the currently available EHL-rFVIII and EHL-rFIX products. Potential impacts of these factors on quality of life, health economics, and immune tolerance treatment will also be discussed alongside the challenges in pharmacokinetic-driven prophylaxis and difficulties in monitoring the EHL products with laboratory assays.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Muhlis Cem Ar, Can Balkan, Kaan Kavaklı<br><b>Journal:</b> Turk J Haematol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1308-5263<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.282<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088040">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dental management of patients with haemophilia in the era of recombinant treatments: increased efficacy and decreased clinical risk.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Haemophilia is a hereditary X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of either clotting factor VIII (haemophilia A) or IX (haemophilia B).

Current treatments are based on regular infusions of FVIII concentrates throughout a patient's life. Alternatively, viral gene therapies that directly deliver F8 in vivo have shown preliminary successes. However, hurdles remain, including lack of infection specificity and the inability to deliver the full-length version of F8 due to restricted viral cargo sizes. Here, we developed an alternative nonviral ex vivo gene-therapy approach that enables the overexpression of full-length F8 in patients' endothelial cells (ECs). We first generated HA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (HA-iPSCs) from urine epithelial cells and genetically modified them using a piggyBac DNA transposon system to insert multiple copies of full-length F8. We subsequently differentiated the modified HA-iPSCs into competent ECs with high efficiency, and demonstrated that the cells (termed HA-FLF8-iECs) were capable of producing high levels of FVIII. Importantly, following subcutaneous implantation into immunodeficient hemophilic (SCID-f8ko) mice, we demonstrated that HA-FLF8-iECs were able to self-assemble into vascular networks, and that the newly formed microvessels had the capacity to deliver functional FVIII directly into the bloodstream of the mice, effectively correcting the clotting deficiency. Moreover, our implant maintains cellular confinement, which reduces potential safety concerns and allows effective monitoring and reversibility. We envision that this proof-of-concept study could become the basis for a novel autologous ex vivo gene-therapy approach to treat HA.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Neumeyer, Ruei-Zeng Lin, Kai Wang, Xuechong Hong, Tien Hua, Stacy E Croteau, Ellis J Neufeld, Juan M Melero-Martin<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31851760">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> New therapies for von Willebrand disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The management of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is based upon the dual correction of the primary hemostasis defect, due to the inherited deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), and of the secondary defect of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C), due to the loss of binding and stabilization by VWF of this intrinsic coagulation factor in flowing blood. The traditional therapeutic weapons (the synthetic derivative of the antidiuretic hormone desmopressin and plasma-derived VWF/FVIII concentrates) are able to transiently correct both the defects. With the goal of tackling the primary deficiency in the disease, that is, VWF, but at the same time exploiting the normal capacity of patients to produce FVIII, the novel approach of replacing only VWF was implemented in the last 10 years. Following the manufacturing of a concentrate fractionated from human plasma and of one obtained by recombinant DNA technology, clinical studies have shown that VWF-only products correct not only the primary VWF deficiency but also the secondary FVIII:C deficiency. The demonstrated efficacy of these products in various clinical situations and, ultimately, in such a hemostasis-challenging context as surgery testifies to the effectiveness and safety of this approach. It remains to be seen whether VWF-only products are efficacious and safe in still-unexplored situations, such as use in children; the long-term use for prophylaxis; and in recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to angiodysplasia, a major therapeutic problem in VWD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Pier Mannuccio Mannucci<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31714963">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061 phase 2b): normal/near normal FIX activity and bleed cessation in hemophilia B.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Etranacogene dezaparvovec (AMT-061) is a recombinant AAV5 vector including a gene cassette containing the factor IX (FIX) Padua variant under the control of a liver-specific promoter. A phase 2b study was conducted to confirm that a single dose of 2 × 1013 genome copies per kilogram of etranacogene dezaparvovec will result in FIX activity ≥5% 6 weeks after dosing. Secondary end points included FIX activity at other time points, bleed frequency, FIX replacement, and safety. Etranacogene dezaparvovec was administered as a single IV infusion to 3 adults with severe to moderately severe hemophilia B. Before treatment, participants had low levels of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to AAV5. This article reports a planned 26-week interim assessment. At week 6, mean FIX activity was 31% (23.9%-37.8%), increasing to 47% (33.2%-57.0%) at 26 weeks, with 2 subjects exhibiting sustained activity >40%. Consistent with the FIX activity, etranacogene dezaparvovec was associated with a complete bleed cessation with no need for FIX replacement therapy up to 26 weeks. Etranacogene dezaparvovec was generally well tolerated. No clinically significant elevations in levels of liver enzymes or inflammatory markers were observed, and no use of corticosteroids related to treatment was required. In individuals with severe to moderately severe hemophilia B, etranacogene dezaparvovec resulted in clinically relevant increases in FIX activity, cessation of bleeds, and abrogation of the need for FIX replacement, despite the presence of preexisting anti-AAV5 neutralizing antibodies detected by using a highly sensitive luciferase assay.

Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that the immune response against FVIII is CD4 T-cell-dependent and many FVIII-derived CD4 epitopes have already been discovered, the role of T follicular helper (TFH) cells in FVIII inhibitor development is unknown. TFH cells, a newly identified subset of CD4 T cells, are characterized by expression of the B-cell follicle-homing receptor CXCR5 and PD-1. In this study, we show for the first time that IV FVIII immunization induces activation and accumulation and/or expansion of PD-1+CXCR5+ TFH cells in the spleen of FVIII-deficient (FVIIInull) mice. FVIII inhibitor-producing mice showed increased germinal center (GC) formation and increased GC TFH cells in response to FVIII immunization. Emergence of TFH cells correlated with titers of anti-FVIII inhibitors. Rechallenge with FVIII antigen elicited recall responses of TFH cells. In vitro FVIII restimulation resulted in antigen-specific proliferation of splenic CD4+ T cells from FVIII-primed FVIIInull mice, and the proliferating cells expressed the TFH hallmark transcription factor BCL6. CXCR5+/+ TFH-cell-specific deletion impaired anti-FVIII inhibitor production, confirming the essential role of CXCR5+/+ TFH cells for the generation of FVIII-neutralizing antibodies. Together, our results demonstrate that the induction of activated TFH cells in FVIIInull mice is critical for FVIII inhibitor development, suggesting that inhibition of FVIII-specific TFH-cell activation may be a promising strategy for preventing anti-FVIII inhibitor formation in patients with HA.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Weiqing Jing, Juan Chen, Yuanhua Cai, Yingyu Chen, Jocelyn A Schroeder, Bryon D Johnson, Weiguo Cui, Qizhen Shi<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648333">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Progenitor-derived human endothelial cells evade alloimmunity by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated complete ablation of MHC expression.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Tissue engineering may address organ shortages currently limiting clinical transplantation. Off-the-shelf engineered vascularized organs will likely use allogeneic endothelial cells (ECs) to construct microvessels required for graft perfusion. Vasculogenic ECs can be differentiated from committed progenitors (human endothelial colony-forming cells or HECFCs) without risk of mutation or teratoma formation associated with reprogrammed stem cells. Like other ECs, these cells can express both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, bind donor-specific antibody (DSA), activate alloreactive T effector memory cells, and initiate rejection in the absence of donor leukocytes. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated dual ablation of β2-microglobulin and class II transactivator (CIITA) in HECFC-derived ECs eliminates both class I and II MHC expression while retaining EC functions and vasculogenic potential. Importantly, dually ablated ECs no longer bind human DSA or activate allogeneic CD4+ effector memory T cells and are resistant to killing by CD8+ alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. Despite absent class I MHC molecules, these ECs do not activate or elicit cytotoxic activity from allogeneic natural killer cells. These data suggest that HECFC-derived ECs lacking MHC molecule expression can be utilized for engineering vascularized grafts that evade allorejection.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Merola, Melanie Reschke, Richard W Pierce, Lingfeng Qin, Susann Spindler, Tania Baltazar, Thomas D Manes, Francesc Lopez-Giraldez, Guangxin Li, Laura G Bracaglia, Catherine Xie, Nancy Kirkiles-Smith, W Mark Saltzman, Gregory T Tietjen, George Tellides, Jordan S Pober<br><b>Journal:</b> JCI Insight<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2379-3708<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527312">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> High-level protein production in erythroid cells derived from in vivo transduced hematopoietic stem cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> We developed an in vivo hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transduction approach that involves HSC mobilization from the bone marrow into the peripheral bloodstream and the IV injection of an integrating, helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd5/35<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Hongjie Wang, Zhinan Liu, Chang Li, Sucheol Gil, Thalia Papayannopoulou, Christopher B Doering, André Lieber<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585952">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Debutant iOS app and gene-disease complexities in clinical genomics and precision medicine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the availability of scientific data, where human-related biological databases have grown not only in count but also in volume, posing unprecedented challenges in data storage, processing, analysis, exchange, and curation. Next generation sequencing (NGS) advancements have facilitated and accelerated the process of identifying genetic variations. Adopting NGS with Whole-Genome and RNA sequencing in a diagnostic context has the potential to improve disease-risk detection in support of precision medicine and drug discovery. Several bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to strengthen variant interpretation by efficiently processing and analyzing sequence data, whereas many published results show how genomics data can be proactively incorporated into medical practices and improve utilization of clinical information. To utilize the wealth of genomics and health, there is a crucial need to generate appropriate gene-disease annotation repositories accessed through modern technology.
RESULTS: Our focus here is to create a comprehensive database with mobile access to actionable genes and classified diseases, considered the foundation for clinical genomics and precision medicine. We present a publicly available iOS app, PAS-Gen, which invites global users to freely download it on iPhone and iPad devices, quickly adopt its easy to use interface, and search for genes and related diseases. PAS-Gen was developed using Swift, XCODE, and PHP scripting that uses Web and MySQL database servers, which includes over 59,000 protein-coding and non-coding genes, and over 90,000 classified gene-disease associations. PAS-Gen is founded on the clinical and scientific premise that easier healthcare and genomics data sharing will accelerate future medical discoveries.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a cutting-edge gene-disease database with a smart phone application, integrating information on classified diseases and related genes. The PAS-Gen app will assist researchers, medical practitioners, and pharmacists by providing a broad and view of genes that may be implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. This tool with accelerate users' abilities to understand the genetic basis of human complex diseases and by assimilating genomic and phenotypic data will support future work to identify gene-specific designer drugs, target precise molecular fingerprints for tumors, suggest appropriate drug therapies, predict individual susceptibility to disease, and diagnose and treat rare illnesses.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Zeeshan Ahmed, Saman Zeeshan, Ruoyun Xiong, Bruce T Liang<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2001-1326<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586224">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> TAFI deficiency causes maladaptive vascular remodeling after hemophilic joint bleeding.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Excessive vascular remodeling is characteristic of hemophilic arthropathy (HA) and may contribute to joint bleeding and the progression of HA. Mechanisms for pathological vascular remodeling after hemophilic joint bleeding are unknown. In hemophilia, activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is impaired, which contributes to joint bleeding and may also underlie the aberrant vascular remodeling. Here, hemophilia A (factor VIII-deficient; FVIII-deficient) mice or TAFI-deficient mice with transient (antibody-induced) hemophilia A were used to determine the role of FVIII and TAFI in vascular remodeling after joint bleeding. Excessive vascular remodeling and vessel enlargement persisted in FVIII-deficient and TAFI-deficient mice, but not in transient hemophilia WT mice, after similar joint bleeding. TAFI-overexpression in FVIII-deficient mice prevented abnormal vessel enlargement and vascular leakage. Age-related vascular changes were observed with FVIII or TAFI deficiency and correlated positively with bleeding severity after injury, supporting increased vascularity as a major contributor to joint bleeding. Antibody-mediated inhibition of uPA also prevented abnormal vascular remodeling, suggesting that TAFI's protective effects include inhibition of uPA-mediated plasminogen activation. In conclusion, the functional TAFI deficiency in hemophilia drives maladaptive vascular remodeling in the joints after bleeding.

Among commonly adopted approaches, only organ transplantation can radically help patients with end-stage liver pathologies. Cell therapy with hepatocytes as a treatment for chronic liver disease has demonstrated promising results. However, quality human hepatocytes are in short supply. Stem/progenitor cells capable of differentiating into functionally active hepatocytes provide an attractive alternative approach to cell therapy for liver diseases, as well as to liver-tissue engineering, drug screening, and basic research. The application of methods generally used to isolate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and maintain them in culture to human liver tissue provides cells, designated here as liver MSCs. They have much in common with MSCs from other tissues, but differ in two aspects-expression of a range of hepatocyte-specific genes and, possibly, inherent commitment to hepatogenic differentiation. The aim of this review is to analyze data regarding liver MSCs, probably another type of liver stem/progenitor cells different from hepatic stellate cells or so-called hepatic progenitor cells. The review presents an analysis of the phenotypic characteristics of liver MSCs, their differentiation and therapeutic potential, methods for isolating these cells from human liver, and discusses issues of their origin and heterogeneity. Human liver MSCs are a fascinating object of fundamental research with a potential for important practical applications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Irina V Kholodenko, Leonid K Kurbatov, Roman V Kholodenko, Garik V Manukyan, Konstantin N Yarygin<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546729">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nongenotoxic antibody-drug conjugate conditioning enables safe and effective platelet gene therapy of hemophilia A mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene therapy offers the potential to cure hemophilia A (HA). We have shown that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based platelet-specific factor VIII (FVIII) (2bF8) gene therapy can produce therapeutic protein and induce antigen-specific immune tolerance in HA mice, even in the presence of inhibitory antibodies. For HSC-based gene therapy, traditional preconditioning using cytotoxic chemotherapy or total body irradiation (TBI) has been required. The potential toxicity associated with TBI or chemotherapy is a deterrent that may prevent patients with HA, a nonmalignant disease, from agreeing to such a protocol. Here, we describe targeted nongenotoxic preconditioning for 2bF8 gene therapy utilizing a hematopoietic cell-specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which consists of saporin conjugated to CD45.2- and CD117-targeting antibodies. We found that a combination of CD45.2- and CD117-targeting ADC preconditioning was effective for engrafting 2bF8-transduced HSCs and was favorable for platelet lineage reconstitution. Two thirds of HA mice that received 2bF8 lentivirus-transduced HSCs under (CD45.2+CD117)-targeting ADC conditioning maintained sustained therapeutic levels of platelet FVIII expression. When CD8-targeting ADC was supplemented, chimerism and platelet FVIII expression were significantly increased, with long-term sustained platelet FVIII expression in all primary and secondary recipients. Importantly, immune tolerance was induced and hemostasis was restored in a tail-bleeding test, and joint bleeding also was effectively prevented in a needle-induced knee joint injury model in HA mice after 2bF8 gene therapy. In summary, we show for the first time efficient engraftment of gene-modified HSCs without genotoxic conditioning. The combined cocktail ADC-mediated hematopoietic cell-targeted nongenotoxic preconditioning that we developed is highly effective and favorable for platelet-specific gene therapy in HA mice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Chunyan Gao, Jocelyn A Schroeder, Feng Xue, Weiqing Jing, Yuanhua Cai, Amelia Scheck, Saravanan Subramaniam, Sridhar Rao, Hartmut Weiler, Agnieszka Czechowicz, Qizhen Shi<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515232">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Functions and the Emerging Role of the Foetal Liver into Regenerative Medicine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> During foetal life, the liver plays the important roles of connection and transient hematopoietic function. Foetal liver cells develop in an environment called a hematopoietic stem cell niche composed of several cell types, where stem cells can proliferate and give rise to mature blood cells. Embryologically, at about the third week of gestation, the liver appears, and it grows rapidly from the fifth to 10th week under WNT/β-Catenin signaling pathway stimulation, which induces hepatic progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation into hepatocytes. Development of new strategies and identification of new cell sources should represent the main aim in liver regenerative medicine and cell therapy. Cells isolated from organs with endodermal origin, like the liver, bile ducts, and pancreas, could be preferable cell sources. Furthermore, stem cells isolated from these organs could be more susceptible to differentiate into mature liver cells after transplantation with respect to stem cells isolated from organs or tissues with a different embryological origin. The foetal liver possesses unique features given the co-existence of cells having endodermal and mesenchymal origin, and it could be highly available source candidate for regenerative medicine in both the liver and pancreas. Taking into account these advantages, the foetal liver can be the highest potential and available cell source for cell therapy regarding liver diseases and diabetes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Antonella Giancotti, Marco Monti, Lorenzo Nevi, Samira Safarikia, Valentina D’Ambrosio, Roberto Brunelli, Cristina Pajno, Sara Corno, Violante Di Donato, Angela Musella, Michele Francesco Chiappetta, Daniela Bosco, Pierluigi Benedetti Panici, Domenico Alvaro, Vincenzo Cardinale<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426422">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mild-severe hemophilia B impacts relationships of US adults and children with hemophilia B and their families: results from the B-HERO-S study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: The B-HERO-S study evaluated the impact of mild to severe hemophilia B on the lives of affected adults and children. Here, we assessed the impact of hemophilia B on relationships.
Methods: US adults with hemophilia B and caregivers of affected children completed separate online surveys that included questions regarding impact of the disease on interpersonal relationships.
Results: Most (88%) of the 299 adults completing the survey had mild to moderate hemophilia B. Of those, 54% were married or in a long-term relationship, and 44% were single. Most adults (87%) reported that hemophilia affected their ability to form close relationships with partners or prospective partners; 35% were very/quite dissatisfied with the support received from a previous partner. Nearly all participants (98%) were very/quite satisfied with the support received from their current partner. Most were very/quite satisfied with the support from family (87%) and friends (96%). Most participants reported a negative reaction or experience as a result of disclosing their hemophilia (friend/colleague/employer, 76%/80%/82%, respectively). Of 150 caregivers of children with mostly mild to moderate hemophilia (74%), 89% were married or in a long-term relationship, and most felt very well/quite supported by their partner (98%) and family (92%). Most felt very/quite satisfied with the support of teachers (94%), children at school (80%), and other adults in regular contact (72%). Most caregivers reported negative experiences telling a friend (76%) or having their child tell a friend (69%) about the child's hemophilia; 43% reported that their child was bullied because of his/her hemophilia.
Conclusion: Although the impact of severe hemophilia on relationships has been reported in HERO and other studies, B-HERO-S suggested that mild to moderate hemophilia B also significantly influences relationships of affected men/women and boys/girls, especially in disclosing their diagnosis, selecting a partner, and feeling bullied by peers/colleagues.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Susan Cutter, Christine Guelcher, Susan Hunter, Dawn Rotellini, Spencer Dunn, David L Cooper<br><b>Journal:</b> Patient Relat Outcome Meas<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1179-271X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496854">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Coupling AAV-mediated promoterless gene targeting to SaCas9 nuclease to efficiently correct liver metabolic diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Non-integrative AAV-mediated gene therapy in the liver is effective in adult patients, but faces limitations in pediatric settings due to episomal DNA loss during hepatocyte proliferation. Gene targeting is a promising approach by permanently modifying the genome. We previously rescued neonatal lethality in Crigler-Najjar mice by inserting a promoterless human uridine glucuronosyl transferase A1 (UGT1A1) cDNA in exon 14 of the albumin gene, without the use of nucleases. To increase recombination rate and therapeutic efficacy, here we used CRISPR/SaCas9. Neonatal mice were transduced with two AAVs: one expressing the SaCas9 and sgRNA, and one containing a promoterless cDNA flanked by albumin homology regions. Targeting efficiency increased ~26-fold with an eGFP reporter cDNA, reaching up to 24% of eGFP-positive hepatocytes. Next, we fully corrected the diseased phenotype of Crigler-Najjar mice by targeting the hUGT1A1 cDNA. Treated mice had normal plasma bilirubin up to 10 months after administration, hUGT1A1 protein levels were ~6-fold higher than in WT liver, with a 90-fold increase in recombination rate. Liver histology, inflammatory markers, and plasma albumin were normal in treated mice, with no off-targets in predicted sites. Thus, the improved efficacy and reassuring safety profile support the potential application of the proposed approach to other liver diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Alessia De Caneva, Fabiola Porro, Giulia Bortolussi, Riccardo Sola, Michela Lisjak, Adi Barzel, Mauro Giacca, Mark A Kay, Kristian Vlahoviček, Lorena Zentilin, Andrés F Muro<br><b>Journal:</b> JCI Insight<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2379-3708<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211694">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Five Years of Successful Inducible Transgene Expression Following Locoregional Adeno-Associated Virus Delivery in Nonhuman Primates with No Detectable Immunity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Anti-transgene immune responses elicited after intramuscular (i.m.) delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) have been shown to hamper long-term transgene expression in large-animal models of rAAV-mediated gene transfer. To overcome this hurdle, an alternative mode of delivery of rAAV vectors in nonhuman primate muscles has been described: the locoregional (LR) intravenous route of administration. Using this injection mode, persistent inducible transgene expression for at least 1 year under the control of the tetracycline-inducible Tet-On system was previously reported in cynomolgus monkeys, with no immunity against the rtTA transgene product. The present study shows the long-term follow-up of these animals. It is reported that LR delivery of a rAAV2/1 vector allows long-term inducible expression up to at least 5 years post gene transfer, with no any detectable host immune response against the transactivator rtTA, despite its immunogenicity following i.m. gene transfer. This study shows for the first time a long-term regulation of muscle gene expression using a Tet-On-inducible system in a large-animal model. Moreover, these findings further confirm that the rAAV LR delivery route is efficient and immunologically safe, allowing long-term skeletal muscle gene transfer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-02-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Mickaël Guilbaud, Marie Devaux, Celia Couzinié, Johanne Le Duff, Alice Toromanoff, Céline Vandamme, Nicolas Jaulin, Gwladys Gernoux, Thibaut Larcher, Philippe Moullier, Caroline Le Guiner, Oumeya Adjali<br><b>Journal:</b> Hum.

Sites where mutations occur with higher frequency than would be expected by chance are termed hotspots while sites that contain mutations rarely are termed coldspots. Mutations are permanently scanned and repaired by repair systems. Among them, the mismatch repair targets base pair mismatches, which are discriminated from canonical base pairs by probing altered elasticity of DNA. Using biased molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the elasticity of coldspots and hotspots motifs detected in human genes associated with inherited disorders, and also of motifs with Czech population hotspots and de novo mutations. Main attention was paid to mutations leading to G/T and A+/C pairs. We observed that hotspots without CpG/CpHpG sequences are less flexible than coldspots, which indicates that flexible sequences are more effectively repaired. In contrary, hotspots with CpG/CpHpG sequences exhibited increased flexibility as coldspots. Their mutability is more likely related to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines leading to C > T mutations, which are primarily targeted by base excision repair. We corroborated conclusions based on computer simulations by measuring melting curves of hotspots and coldspots containing G/T mismatch.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Michal Růžička, Přemysl Souček, Petr Kulhánek, Lenka Radová, Lenka Fajkusová, Kamila Réblová<br><b>Journal:</b> DNA Res.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-1663<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31230075">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hyperactivity of factor IX Padua (R338L) depends on factor VIIIa cofactor activity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Adeno-associated-viral (AAV) vector liver-directed gene therapy (GT) for hemophilia B (HB) is limited by a vector-dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. Recently, this obstacle has been partially circumvented by the use of a hyperactive factor IX (FIX) variant, R338L (Padua), which has an eightfold increased specific activity compared to FIX-WT. FIX-R338L has emerged as the standard for HB GT. However, the underlying mechanism of its hyperactivity is undefined; as such, safety concerns of unregulated coagulation and the potential for thrombotic complications have not been fully addressed. To this end, we evaluated the enzymatic and clotting activity as well as the activation, inactivation, and cofactor-dependence of FIX-R338L relative to FIX-WT. We observed that the high-specific-activity of FIX-R338L requires factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) cofactor. In a novel system utilizing emicizumab, a FVIII-mimicking bispecific antibody, the hyperactivity of both recombinant FIX-R338L and AAV-mediated-transgene-expressed FIX-R338L from HB GT subjects is ablated without FVIIIa activity. We conclude that the molecular regulation of activation, inactivation, and cofactor-dependence of FIX-R338L is similar to FIX-WT, but that the FVIIIa-dependent hyperactivity of FIX-R338L is the result of a faster rate of factor X activation. This mechanism helps mitigate safety concerns of unregulated coagulation and supports the expanded use of FIX-R338L in HB therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin J Samelson-Jones, Jonathan D Finn, Lindsey A George, Rodney M Camire, Valder R Arruda<br><b>Journal:</b> JCI Insight<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2379-3708<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219805">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Application of Indirect Linkage Analysis for Carrier Detection of Hemophilia A in Kurdistan Region of Iraq: Usefulness of Intron 18 BclI T>A, Intron 19 HindIII C>T, and IVS7 nt27 G>A Markers.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Hemophilia A (HA) is the most common congenital X-linked coagulopathy caused by mutations in the factor VIII gene. One in 5000 to 10 000 male persons worldwide suffer from HA. It is the archetype of high-cost, low-volume disease. Therefore, identification of carriers is crucial to avoid the birth of affected males. Tracking of the defective X chromosome through indirect linkage analysis represents the most practical method for screening for carriers in developing countries. In this study, 227 individuals from 41 families with HA and 100 normal participants were recruited from the Kurdistan region of Iraq and evaluated for intron 18 BclI, intron 19 HindIII, and IVS7 nt 27 markers by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing.

So far, many iPSC-derived disease models have led to the discovery of novel pathological mechanisms as well as new drugs in the pipeline that have been tested in the iPSC-derived cells for efficacy and potential toxicities. Furthermore, recent advances in genome editing technology in combination with the iPSC technology have provided a versatile platform for studying stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.

In consequence, patients and their families are often unable to find an expert for their affliction, let alone a cure. The tide is turning as pharmaceutical companies embrace gene therapy development and as serviceable tools for the repair of primary mutations separate the ability to create cures from underlying disease expertise. Whereas gene therapy by gene addition took decades to reach the clinic by incremental disease-specific refinements of vectors and methods, gene therapy by genome editing in its basic form merely requires certainty about the causative mutation. Suddenly we move from concept to trial in 3 years instead of 30: therapy development in the fast lane, with all the positive and negative implications of the phrase. Since their first application to eukaryotic cells in 2013, the proliferation and refinement in particular of tools based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) prokaryotic RNA-guided nucleases has prompted a landslide of therapy-development studies for rare diseases.

For many of these disease states and novel approaches to therapy, traditional approaches to clinical trial design fall short, and a number of innovative trial designs have emerged. In light of these changes, regulators across the globe are implementing new programs to provide regular development program support, facilitate accelerated access, use real-world data, and use digital tools to improve patients' lives. Emerging market regulators are also focusing on simplifying their regulatory pathways via regional harmonization schemes with varying levels of ambition. These changes in the external environment imply that biopharma regulatory teams need to adapt and evolve, leveraging digital tools, data, and analytics, and positioning themselves as strategic advisors during development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-01-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Myrto Lee, Hoan Ly, Clemens C Möller, Michael S Ringel<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin.

Success of prophylactic therapy in preventing bleeding and decreasing associated complications has established a new standard of care. However, with the advent of gene therapy and treatments that effectively mimic sustained coagulation factor replacement, outcome measures that worked well for assessing factor replacement therapies in past clinical trials need to be reassessed. In addition, while therapies have advanced, so has the science of outcome assessment, including recognition of the importance of patient important and patient reported outcomes.

The promoter sequence and the regulatory elements involved in the modulation of F8 expression are still poorly characterized and biased by the historical assumption that FVIII expression is mainly in hepatocytes. Bioinformatic analyses have highlighted an underestimated complexity in gene expression at this locus, suggesting an activation of pF8 in more cell types than those previously expected. C57Bl/6 mice injected with a lentiviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the pF8 (lentiviral vector [LV].pF8.GFP) confirm the predominant GFP expression in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, with a few positive cells detectable also in hematopoietic organs. Therapeutic gene delivery (LV.pF8.FVIII) in hemophilic C57/Bl6 and 129-Bl6 mice successfully corrected the bleeding phenotype, rescuing up to 25% FVIII activity, using a codon-optimized FVIII, with sustained activity for the duration of the experiment (1 year) without inhibitor formation. Of note, LV.pF8.FVIII delivery in FVIII-immunized HA mice resulted in the complete reversion of the inhibitor titer with the recovery of therapeutic FVIII activity. Depletion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in LV-treated mice allowed the formation of anti-FVIII antibodies, indicating a role for Tregs in immune tolerance induction. The significant blood loss reduction observed in all LV.pF8.FVIII-treated mice 1 year after injection confirmed the achievement of a long-term phenotypic correction. Altogether, our results highlight the potency of pF8-driven transgene expression to correct the bleeding phenotype in HA, as well as potentially in other diseases in which an endothelial-specific expression is required.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Simone Merlin, Rosella Famà, Ester Borroni, Diego Zanolini, Valentina Bruscaggin, Silvia Zucchelli, Antonia Follenzi<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862611">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Companies</h2> <br><br><b>Company Name:</b> Spark Therapeutics, Inc.<br><b>Overview:</b> At Spark Therapeutics, we don’t follow footsteps.
