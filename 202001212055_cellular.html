In evaluating the potential synergism of combining such strategies, however, we should consider the possibility of constraining trade-off phenotypes such as impairment in wound healing and immune response, tissue dysfunction and tumorigenesis. Moreover, we are rapidly learning that the benefit/risk ratio of aging-targeted interventions largely depends on intra- and inter-individual variations of susceptibility to the healthspan-, resilience-, and/or lifespan-promoting effects of the interventions. Here, we exemplify how computationally-generated proxies of the efficacy of a given lifespan/healthspan-promoting approach can predict the impact of baseline epigenetic heterogeneity on the positive outcomes of ketogenic diet and mTOR inhibition as single or combined anti-aging strategies.

Targeting aging itself might, therefore, be a better strategy than targeting each chronic disease individually for enhancing human health. Although much should be achieved for completely understanding the biological basis of aging, cellular senescence is now believed to mainly contribute to organismal aging via two independent, yet not mutually exclusive mechanisms: on the one hand, senescence of stem cells leads to exhaustion of stem cells and thus decreases tissue regeneration. On the other hand, senescent cells secrete many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases, collectively termed as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which causes chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. Much effort has been recently made to therapeutically target detrimental effects of cellular senescence including selectively eliminating senescent cells (senolytics) and modulating a proinflammatory senescent secretome (senostatics). Here, we discuss current progress and limitations in understanding molecular mechanisms of senolytics and senostatics and therapeutic strategies for applying them. Furthermore, we propose how these novel interventions for aging treatment could be improved, based on lessons learned from cancer treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Chanhee Kang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

Here, we report POLR2A, the largest catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II, as a major target gene down-regulated after XAB2 depletion. XAB2 depletion led to severe splicing defects of POLR2A with significant intron retention. Such defects resulted in substantial loss of POLR2A at RNA and protein levels, which further impaired global transcription. Treatment of splicing inhibitor madrasin induced similar reduction of POLR2A. Screen using TMT-based quantitative proteomics identified several proteins involved in mRNA surveillance including Dom34 with elevated expression. Inhibition of translation or depletion of Dom34 rescued the expression of POLR2A by stabilizing its mRNA. Immuno-precipitation further confirmed that XAB2 associated with spliceosome components important to POLR2A expression. Domain mapping revealed that TPR motifs 2-4 and 11 of XAB2 were critical for POLR2A expression by interacting with SNW1. Finally, we showed POLR2A mediated cell senescence caused by XAB2 deficiency. Depletion of XAB2 or POLR2A induced cell senescence by up-regulation of p53 and p21, re-expression of POLR2A after XAB2 depletion alleviated cellular senescence. These data together support that XAB2 serves as a guardian of POLR2A expression to ensure global gene expression and antagonize cell senescence.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Hou, Dajun Qu, Yue Li, Baohui Zhu, Dapeng Liang, Xinyue Wei, Wei Tang, Qian Zhang, Jiaojiao Hao, Wei Guo, Weijie Wang, Siqi Zhao, Qi Wang, Sikandar Azam, Misbah Khan, Haidong Zhao, Liye Zhang, Haixin Lei<br><b>Journal:</b> Nucleic Acids Res.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1362-4962<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.14<br><b>SJR:</b> 8.636<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216022">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Small Extracellular Vesicles Are Key Regulators of Non-cell Autonomous Intercellular Communication in Senescence via the Interferon Protein IFITM3.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Senescence is a cellular phenotype present in health and disease, characterized by a stable cell-cycle arrest and an inflammatory response called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP is important in influencing the behavior of neighboring cells and altering the microenvironment; yet, this role has been mainly attributed to soluble factors.

NF is a unique pathophysiological model for determining the direct consequences of cell iron dysregulation. We established lines of induced pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts from two NF patients and one isogenic control obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. NF fibroblasts, neural progenitors, and neurons exhibited the presence of increased cytosolic iron, which was also detectable as: ferritin aggregates, alterations in the iron parameters, oxidative damage, and the onset of a senescence phenotype, particularly severe in the neurons. In this spontaneous senescence model, NF cells had impaired survival and died by ferroptosis. Thus, non-ferritin-bound iron is sufficient per se to cause both cell senescence and ferroptotic cell death in human fibroblasts and neurons. These results provide strong evidence supporting the primary role of iron in neuronal aging and degeneration.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-07<br><b>Authors:</b> Anna Cozzi, Daniel I Orellana, Paolo Santambrogio, Alicia Rubio, Cinzia Cancellieri, Serena Giannelli, Maddalena Ripamonti, Stefano Taverna, Giulia Di Lullo, Ermanna Rovida, Maurizio Ferrari, Gian Luca Forni, Chiara Fiorillo, Vania Broccoli, Sonia Levi<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Reports<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2213-6711<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.60<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.698<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587993">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Context-Dependent Impact of RAS Oncogene Expression on Cellular Reprogramming to Pluripotency.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Induction of pluripotency in somatic cells with defined genetic factors has been successfully used to investigate the mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. Cellular reprogramming and oncogenic transformation share common features; both involve undergoing a dramatic change in cell identity, and immortalization is a key step for cancer progression that enhances reprogramming. However, there are very few examples of complete successful reprogramming of tumor cells. Here we address the effect of expressing an active oncogene, RAS, on the process of reprogramming and found that, while combined expression with reprogramming factors enhanced dedifferentiation, expression within the context of neoplastic transformation impaired reprogramming. RAS induces expression changes that promote loss of cell identity and acquisition of stemness in a paracrine manner and these changes result in reprogramming when combined with reprogramming factors.

In the past, iNSCs were generated by transcription factors which increased the risk of mutagenesis, tumor formations, and immune reactions by viral transduction vectors. Therefore, in this study, different small molecules were used to induce mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into iNSCs in different reprogramming stages, which showed high reprogramming efficiency without altering the genome. We demonstrated that the small molecules staged-induction neural stem cells (SMSINS) have the characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs) in morphology, gene expression, self-renewal and differentiation potential. Furthermore, valproic acid (VPA), one of small molecules, was showed to enhance neural induction with highest efficiency compared with six other small molecules, which were also investigated in the present study. Moreover, our results suggested that activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling enhanced the induction efficiency and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our findings indicated that using this induction program allowed us to obtain safe and efficient iNSCs which were free of genetic manipulation. The VPA-mediated mTOR signaling pathway may enhance reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation. So we suggested that this program could be a new method of obtaining iNSCs for the treatment of neurological diseases by cell replacement therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Qingrui Duan, Siyi Li, Xinrui Wen, Gavin Sunnassee, Jian Chen, Sheng Tan, Yang Guo<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1662-4548<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.81<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.665<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551670">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Remodeling of mitochondrial morphology and function: an emerging hallmark of cellular reprogramming.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Research in the stem cell field has traditionally focused on understanding key transcriptional factors that provide pluripotent cell identity.

Recent studies suggest an emerging landscape in which mitochondrial morphology and function have an active role in maintaining and regulating changes in cell identity.

Physiological degeneration and disease onset are common occurrences in the aging population. iPSCs could offer regenerative medical options for age-related degeneration and disease in the elderly. However, reprogramming somatic cells from the elderly is inefficient when successful at all. Perhaps due to their low rates of replication in culture, traditional transduction and reprogramming approaches with centenarian fibroblasts met with little success. A simple and reproducible reprogramming process is reported here which enhances interactions of the cells with the viral vectors that leads to improved iPSC generation. The improved methods efficiently generates fully reprogrammed iPSC lines from 105-107 years old subjects in feeder-free conditions using an episomal, Sendai-Virus (SeV) reprogramming vector expressing four reprogramming factors. In conclusion, dermal fibroblasts from human subjects older than 100 years can be efficiently and reproducibly reprogrammed to fully pluripotent cells with minor modifications to the standard reprogramming procedures. Efficient generation of iPSCs from the elderly may provide a source of cells for the regeneration of tissues and organs with autologous cells as well as cellular models for the study of aging, longevity and age-related diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Massoud Vosough, Francesco Ravaioli, Mihaela Zabulica, Miriam Capri, Paolo Garagnani, Claudio Franceschi, Julie Piccand, Marine R-C Kraus, Kristina Kannisto, Roberto Gramignoli, Stephen C Strom<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.2<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022207">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Glycine cleavage system determines the fate of pluripotent stem cells via the regulation of senescence and epigenetic modifications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Metabolic remodelling has emerged as critical for stem cell pluripotency; however, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that the glycine cleavage system (GCS) is highly activated to promote stem cell pluripotency and during somatic cell reprogramming. Mechanistically, we revealed that the expression of Gldc, a rate-limiting GCS enzyme regulated by Sox2 and Lin28A, facilitates this activation. We further found that the activated GCS catabolizes glycine to fuel H3K4me3 modification, thus promoting the expression of pluripotency genes. Moreover, the activated GCS helps to cleave excess glycine and prevents methylglyoxal accumulation, which stimulates senescence in stem cells and during reprogramming. Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby GCS activation controls stem cell pluripotency by promoting H3K4me3 modification and preventing cellular senescence.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-28<br><b>Authors:</b> Shengya Tian, Junru Feng, Yang Cao, Shengqi Shen, Yongping Cai, Dongdong Yang, Ronghui Yan, Lihua Wang, Huafeng Zhang, Xiuying Zhong, Ping Gao<br><b>Journal:</b> Life Sci Alliance<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2575-1077<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.2<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562192">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The innate immune sensor Toll-like receptor 2 controls the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cellular senescence is a stress response program characterized by a robust cell cycle arrest and the induction of a proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that is triggered through an unknown mechanism.

Recent studies disclosed the emerging roles of heat-shock proteins in regulating muscle regeneration and homeostasis. Here, we found that Hsp90β, but not Hsp90α isoform, was significantly upregulated during muscle regeneration. RNA-seq analysis disclosed a transcriptional elevation of p21 in Hsp90β-depleted myoblasts, which is due to the upregulation of p53. Moreover, knockdown of Hsp90β in myoblasts resulted in p53-dependent cellular senescence. In contrast to the notion that Hsp90 interacts with and protects mutant p53 in cancer, Hsp90β preferentially bound to wild-type p53 and modulated its degradation via a proteasome-dependent manner. Moreover, Hsp90β interacted with MDM2, the chief E3 ligase of p53, to regulate the stability of p53. In line with these in vitro studies, the expression level of p53-p21 axis was negatively correlated with Hsp90β in aged mice muscle. Consistently, administration of 17-AAG, a Hsp90 inhibitor under clinical trial, impaired muscle regeneration by enhancing injury-induced senescence in vivo. Taken together, our finding revealed a previously unappreciated role of Hsp90β in regulating p53 stability to suppress senescence both in vitro and in vivo.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Min Yi He, Shui Bo Xu, Zi Hao Qu, Yue Mei Guo, Xiao Ceng Liu, Xiao Xia Cong, Jian Feng Wang, Boon Chuan Low, Li Li, Qiang Wu, Peng Lin, Shi Gui Yan, Zhang Bao, Yi Ting Zhou, Li Ling Zheng<br><b>Journal:</b> Aging Cell<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1474-9726<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.08<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.809<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313490">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mechanisms of the Metabolic Shift during Somatic Cell Reprogramming.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), hold a huge promise for regenerative medicine, drug development, and disease modeling. PSCs have unique metabolic features that are akin to those of cancer cells, in which glycolysis predominates to produce energy as well as building blocks for cellular components. Recent studies indicate that the unique metabolism in PSCs is not a mere consequence of their preference for a low oxygen environment, but is an active process for maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency, possibly in preparation for rapid response to the metabolic demands of differentiation. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of this unique metabolism in PSCs is essential for proper derivation, generation, and maintenance of PSCs.

Senescent cells accumulate in multiple organs during ageing, contribute to tissue dysfunction and give rise to pathological manifestations. Senescence is therefore a defining feature of a variety of human age-related disorders, including cancer, and targeted elimination of these cells has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to ameliorate tissue damage and promote repair and regeneration.

Global transcriptomic differences, a blunted SASP response, and the induction of fibrillar collagens in secondary senescence point toward a functional diversification between secondary and primary senescence.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Yee Voan Teo, Nattaphong Rattanavirotkul, Nelly Olova, Angela Salzano, Andrea Quintanilla, Nuria Tarrats, Christos Kiourtis, Miryam Müller, Anthony R Green, Peter D Adams, Juan-Carlos Acosta, Thomas G Bird, Kristina Kirschner, Nicola Neretti, Tamir Chandra<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2211-1247<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.70<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.635<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018144">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Direct reprogramming into interneurons: potential for brain repair.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The brain tissue has only a limited capacity for generating new neurons. Therefore, to treat neurological diseases, there is a need of other cell sources for brain repair. Different sources of cells have been subject of intense research over the years, including cells from primary tissue, stem cell-derived cells and reprogrammed cells. As an alternative, direct reprogramming of resident brain cells into neurons is a recent approach that could provide an attractive method for treating brain injuries or diseases as it uses the patient's own cells for generating novel neurons inside the brain. In vivo reprogramming is still in its early stages but holds great promise as an option for cell therapy. To date, both inhibitory and excitatory neurons have been obtained via in vivo reprogramming, but the precise phenotype or functionality of these cells has not been analysed in detail in most of the studies. Recent data shows that in vivo reprogrammed neurons are able to functionally mature and integrate into the existing brain circuitry, and compose interneuron phenotypes that seem to correlate to their endogenous counterparts. Interneurons are of particular importance as they are essential in physiological brain function and when disturbed lead to several neurological disorders. In this review, we describe a comprehensive overview of the existing studies involving brain repair, including in vivo reprogramming, with a focus on interneurons, along with an overview on current efforts to generate interneurons for cell therapy for a number of neurological diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria Pereira, Marcella Birtele, Daniella Rylander Ottosson<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell.

EVs can act in a paracrine manner to facilitate communication between cells as well as modulate immune, inflammatory, regenerative, and remodeling processes. Of particular interest is the emerging association between EVs and stem cells, given their ability to integrate complex inputs for facilitating cellular migration to the sites of tissue injury. Additionally, stem cell-derived EVs can also act in an autocrine manner to influence stem cell proliferation, mobilization, differentiation, and self-renewal. Hence, it has been postulated that stem cells and EVs may work synergistically in the process of tissue repair and that dysregulation of EVs may cause a loss of homeostasis in the microenvironment leading to disease. By harnessing the property of EVs for delivery of small molecules, stem cell-derived EVs possess significant potential as a platform for developing bioengineering approaches for next-generation cancer therapies and targeted drug delivery methods. Although one of the main challenges of clinical cancer treatment remains a lack of specificity for the delivery of effective treatment options, EVs can be modified via genetic, biochemical, or synthetic methods for enhanced targeting ability of chemotherapeutic agents in promoting tumor regression. Here, we summarize recent research on the bioengineering potential of EV-based cancer therapies. A comprehensive understanding of EV modification may provide a novel strategy for cancer therapy and for the utilization of EVs in the targeting of oncogenic processes. Furthermore, innovative and emerging new technologies are shifting the paradigm and playing pivotal roles by continually expanding novel methods and materials for synthetic processes involved in the bioengineering of EVs for enhanced precision therapeutics.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Mujib Ullah, Yang Qiao, Waldo Concepcion, Avnesh S Thakor<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31771657">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Understanding and Modulating Immunity With Cell Reprogramming.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cell reprogramming concepts have been classically developed in the fields of developmental and stem cell biology and are currently being explored for regenerative medicine, given its potential to generate desired cell types for replacement therapy. Cell fate can be experimentally reversed or modified by enforced expression of lineage specific transcription factors leading to pluripotency or attainment of another somatic cell type identity. The possibility to reprogram fibroblasts into induced dendritic cells (DC) competent for antigen presentation creates a paradigm shift for understanding and modulating the immune system with direct cell reprogramming. PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 were identified as sufficient and necessary to impose DC fate in unrelated cell types, taking advantage of Clec9a, a C-type lectin receptor with restricted expression in conventional DC type 1. The identification of such minimal gene regulatory networks helps to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing development and lineage heterogeneity along the hematopoietic hierarchy. Furthermore, the generation of patient-tailored reprogrammed immune cells provides new and exciting tools for the expanding field of cancer immunotherapy.

While typically associated with heritable changes in gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms are now appreciated to regulate dynamic changes in gene expression-even in post-mitotic cells. Cells of the innate immune system, including dendritic cells (DC), rapidly integrate signals from their microenvironment and respond accordingly, undergoing massive changes in transcriptional programming. This dynamic transcriptional reprogramming relies on epigenetic changes mediated by numerous enzymes and their substrates. This review highlights our current understanding of epigenetic regulation of DC function. Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of the steady state and are important for precise responses to proinflammatory stimuli. Interdependence between epigenetic modifications and the delicate balance of metabolites present another layer of complexity. In addition, dynamic regulation of the expression of proteins that modify chromatin architecture in DCs significantly impacts DC function. Environmental factors, including inflammation, aging, chemicals, nutrients, and lipid mediators, are increasingly appreciated to affect the epigenome in DCs, and, in doing so, regulate host immunity. Our understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms regulate DC function is in its infancy, and it must be expanded in order to discern the mechanisms underlying the balance between health and disease states.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Giselle M Boukhaled, Mario Corrado, Hannah Guak, Connie M Krawczyk<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214161">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> miR-200 family members reduce senescence and restore idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis type II alveolar epithelial cell transdifferentiation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Rationale: Alveolar type II (ATII) cells act as adult stem cells contributing to alveolar type I (ATI) cell renewal and play a major role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as supported by familial cases harbouring mutations in genes specifically expressed by these cells. During IPF, ATII cells lose their regenerative potential and aberrantly express pathways contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The microRNA miR-200 family is downregulated in IPF, but its effect on human IPF ATII cells remains unproven. We wanted to 1) evaluate the characteristics and transdifferentiating ability of IPF ATII cells, and 2) test whether miR-200 family members can rescue the regenerative potential of fibrotic ATII cells.
Methods: ATII cells were isolated from control or IPF lungs and cultured in conditions promoting their transdifferentiation into ATI cells. Cells were either phenotypically monitored over time or transfected with miR-200 family members to evaluate the microRNA effect on the expression of transdifferentiation, senescence and EMT markers.
Results: IPF ATII cells show a senescent phenotype (p16 and p21), overexpression of EMT (ZEB1/2) and impaired expression of ATI cell markers (AQP5 and HOPX) after 6 days of culture in differentiating medium. Transfection with certain miR-200 family members (particularly miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p) reduced senescence marker expression and restored the ability to transdifferentiate into ATI cells.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that ATII cells from IPF patients express senescence and EMT markers, and display a reduced ability to transdifferentiate into ATI cells.

While iPSCs are a valuable tool for modeling developmental and monogenetic disorders, their rejuvenated identity poses limitations for modeling age-associated diseases. Direct cell-type conversion of fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) circumvents rejuvenation and preserves hallmarks of cellular aging. iNs are thus advantageous for modeling diseases that possess strong age-related and epigenetic contributions and can complement iPSC-based strategies for disease modeling. In this review, we provide an overview of the state of the art of direct iN conversion and describe the key epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolic changes that occur in converting fibroblasts. Furthermore, we summarize new insights into this fascinating process, particularly focusing on the rapidly changing criteria used to define and characterize in vitro-born human neurons.

However, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) retain transcriptional memory, epigenetic memory, and metabolic memory from their somatic cells of origin and acquire aberrant characteristics distinct from either other pluripotent cells or parental cells, reflecting incomplete reprogramming. As a critical link between the microenvironment and regulation of the epigenome, nutrient availability likely plays a significant role in the retention of somatic cell memory by iPSC. Significantly, relative nutrient availability impacts iPSC reprogramming efficiency, epigenetic regulation and cell fate, and differentially alters their ability to respond to physiological stimuli. The significance of metabolites during the reprogramming process is central to further elucidating how iPSC retain somatic cell characteristics and optimising culture conditions to generate iPSC with physiological phenotypes to ensure their reliable use in basic research and clinical applications.

Many studies have demonstrated the detrimental effects of apoE4 in varying cellular contexts. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining how apoE4 leads to cognitive decline are not fully understood. Recently, the combination of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) modeling of neurological diseases in vitro and electrophysiological studies in vivo have begun to unravel the intersection between apoE4, neuronal subtype dysfunction or loss, subsequent network deficits, and eventual cognitive decline. In this review, we provide an overview of the literature describing apoE4's detrimental effects in the central nervous system (CNS), specifically focusing on its contribution to neuronal subtype dysfunction or loss. We focus on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus, which are selectively vulnerable to apoE4-mediated neurotoxicity. Additionally, we discuss the importance of the GABAergic inhibitory network to proper cognitive function and how dysfunction of this network manifests in AD. Finally, we examine how apoE4-mediated GABAergic interneuron loss can lead to inhibitory network deficits and how this deficit results in cognitive decline. We propose the following working model: Aging and/or stress induces neuronal expression of apoE. GABAergic interneurons are selectively vulnerable to intracellularly produced apoE4, through a tau dependent mechanism, which leads to their dysfunction and eventual death. In turn, GABAergic interneuron loss causes hyperexcitability and dysregulation of neural networks in the hippocampus and cortex. This dysfunction results in learning, memory, and other cognitive deficits that are the central features of AD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Ramsey Najm, Emily A Jones, Yadong Huang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Neurodegener<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1750-1326<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 8.38<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.988<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186040">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> microRNAs Are Key Regulators in Chronic Lung Disease: Exploring the Vital Link between Disease Progression and Lung Cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to mRNAs and inhibit their expression through post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression.

Moreover, p53 serves as a barrier for dedifferentiation and reprogramming by constraining the cells to a somatic state and preventing their conversion to SCs. On the contrary, the mutant forms of p53 that lost their tumor suppressor activity and gain oncogenic functions serve as 'inducers of tissue anarchy' and promote cancer development.

However, how the entry-exit mechanisms of phenotype reprogramming are established remains poorly understood. In an attempt to elucidate such mechanisms, we herein introduce a stochastic model of combined epigenetic regulation (ER)-gene regulatory network (GRN) to study the plastic phenotypic behaviours driven by ER heterogeneity. To deal with such complex system, we additionally formulate a multiscale asymptotic method for stochastic model reduction, from which we derive an efficient hybrid simulation scheme. Our analysis of the coupled system reveals a regime of tristability in which pluripotent stem-like and differentiated steady-states coexist with a third indecisive state, with ER driving transitions between these states. Crucially, ER heterogeneity of differentiation genes is for the most part responsible for conferring abnormal robustness to pluripotent stem-like states. We formulate epigenetic heterogeneity-based strategies capable of unlocking and facilitating the transit from differentiation-refractory (stem-like) to differentiation-primed epistates. The application of the hybrid numerical method validates the likelihood of such switching involving solely kinetic changes in epigenetic factors. Our results suggest that epigenetic heterogeneity regulates the mechanisms and kinetics of phenotypic robustness of cell fate reprogramming. The occurrence of tunable switches capable of modifying the nature of cell fate reprogramming might pave the way for new therapeutic strategies to regulate reparative reprogramming in ageing and cancer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Núria Folguera-Blasco, Rubén Pérez-Carrasco, Elisabet Cuyàs, Javier A Menendez, Tomás Alarcón<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS Comput.

Quiescent cells do not divide, but can re-enter the cell cycle and resume proliferation if exposed to some signals from the environment. Quiescent cells in mammals and humans include adult stem cells. These cells exhibit improved stress resistance and enhanced survival ability. In response to certain extrinsic signals, adult stem cells can self-renew by dividing asymmetrically. Such asymmetric divisions not only allow the maintenance of a population of quiescent cells, but also yield daughter progenitor cells. A multistep process of the controlled proliferation of these progenitor cells leads to the formation of one or more types of fully differentiated cells. An age-related decline in the ability of adult stem cells to balance quiescence maintenance and regulated proliferation has been implicated in many aging-associated diseases.

In particular, we investigated proteomic and epigenetic changes in BDSCs during osteoblastic differentiation induced by rapamycin under microgravity conditions. A decrease in the expression of 4 embryonic markers (Sox2, Oct3/4, Nanog and E-cadherin) was found to occur to a larger extent on board the ISS than on Earth, along with an earlier activation of the differentiation process towards the osteogenic lineage. The changes in the expression of 4 transcription factors (Otx2, Snail, GATA4 and Sox17) engaged in osteogenesis supported these findings.

Indeed, we found that H3K4me3, H3K27me2/3, H3K79me2/3 and H3K9me2/3 residues are engaged in cellular reprogramming that drives gene expression. Overall, we suggest that rapamycin induces transcriptional activation of BDSCs towards osteogenic differentiation, through increased GATA4 and Sox17 that modulate downstream transcription factors (like Runx2), critical for bone formation. Additional studies are warranted to ascertain the possible exploitation of these data to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets to treat osteoporosis, not only in Space but also on Earth.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Alessandra Gambacurta, Giulia Merlini, Cristina Ruggiero, Giacomo Diedenhofen, Natalia Battista, Monica Bari, Michele Balsamo, Sara Piccirillo, Giovanni Valentini, Gabriele Mascetti, Mauro Maccarrone<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171801">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A compendious summary of Parkinson's disease patient-derived iPSCs in the first decade.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The number of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients increases with aging, which brings heavy burden to families and society. The emergence of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has brought hope to the current situation of lacking new breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment of PD. In this article, we reviewed and analyzed the current researches related to PD patient-derived iPSCs, in order to provide solid theoretical basis for future study of PD. In 2008, successful iPSCs derived from PD patients were reported. The current iPSCs research in PD mostly focused on the establishment of specific iPSCs models of PD patients carrying susceptible genes. The main source of PD patient-derived iPSCs is skin fibroblasts and the mainstream reprogramming methodology is the mature "four-factor" method, which introduces four totipotent correlation factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc into somatic cells. The main sources of iPSCs are patients with non-pedigrees and there have been no studies involving both PD patients and unaffected carriers within the same family. Most of the existing studies of PD patient-derived iPSCs started with the induction method for obtaining dopaminergic neurons in the first instance, but therapeutic applications are being increased. Although it is not the ultimate panacea, and there are still some unsolved problems (e.g., whether the mutated genes should be corrected or not), a better understanding of iPSCs may be a good gift for both PD patients and doctors due to their advantages in diagnosis and treatment of PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Chao Ren, Fen Wang, Li-Na Guan, Xiao-Yu Cheng, Cai-Yi Zhang, De-Qin Geng, Chun-Feng Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Ann Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2305-5839<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.27<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.958<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31930086">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> p73 regulates epidermal wound healing and induced keratinocyte programming.<br><b>Abstract:</b> p63 is a transcriptional regulator of ectodermal development that is required for basal cell proliferation and stem cell maintenance. p73 is a closely related p53 family member that is expressed in select p63-positive basal cells and can heterodimerize with p63. p73-/- mice lack multiciliated cells and have reduced numbers of basal epithelial cells in select tissues; however, the role of p73 in basal epithelial cells is unknown. Herein, we show that p73-deficient mice exhibit delayed wound healing despite morphologically normal-appearing skin. The delay in wound healing is accompanied by decreased proliferation and increased levels of biomarkers of the DNA damage response in basal keratinocytes at the epidermal wound edge. In wild-type mice, this same cell population exhibited increased p73 expression after wounding. Analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data, we found that p73 was expressed by epidermal and hair follicle stem cells, cell types required for wound healing. Moreover, we discovered that p73 isoforms expressed in the skin (ΔNp73) enhance p63-mediated expression of keratinocyte genes during cellular reprogramming from a mesenchymal to basal keratinocyte-like cell. We identified a set of 44 genes directly or indirectly regulated by ΔNp73 that are involved in skin development, cell junctions, cornification, proliferation, and wound healing. Our results establish a role for p73 in cutaneous wound healing through regulation of basal keratinocyte function.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-19<br><b>Authors:</b> J Scott Beeler, Clayton B Marshall, Paula I Gonzalez-Ericsson, Timothy M Shaver, Gabriela L Santos Guasch, Spencer T Lea, Kimberly N Johnson, Hailing Jin, Bryan J Venters, Melinda E Sanders, Jennifer A Pietenpol<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216312">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Using Dental Pulp Stem Cells for Stroke Therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Stroke is a leading cause of permanent disability world-wide, but aside from rehabilitation, there is currently no clinically-proven pharmaceutical or biological agent to improve neurological disability. Cell-based therapies using stem cells, such as dental pulp stem cells, are a promising alternative for treatment of neurological diseases, including stroke. The ischaemic environment in stroke affects multiple cell populations, thus stem cells, which act through cellular and molecular mechanisms, are promising candidates. The most common stem cell population studied in the neurological setting has been mesenchymal stem cells due to their accessibility. However, it is believed that neural stem cells, the resident stem cell of the adult brain, would be most appropriate for brain repair. Using reprogramming strategies, alternative sources of neural stem and progenitor cells have been explored. We postulate that a cell of closer origin to the neural lineage would be a promising candidate for reprogramming and modification towards a neural stem or progenitor cell. One such candidate population is dental pulp stem cells, which reside in the root canal of teeth. This review will focus on the neural potential of dental pulp stem cells and their investigations in the stroke setting to date, and include an overview on the use of different sources of neural stem cells in preclinical studies and clinical trials of stroke.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria R Gancheva, Karlea L Kremer, Stan Gronthos, Simon A Koblar<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Neurol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-2295<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.75<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.185<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31110489">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Impelling force and current challenges by chemicals in somatic cell reprogramming and expansion beyond hepatocytes.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In the field of regenerative medicine, generating numerous transplantable functional cells in the laboratory setting on a large scale is a major challenge.

A major advantage of human iPSC, compared to the pluripotent embryonic stem cells, is that they can be generated from virtually any embryonic or adult somatic cell type without destruction of human blastocysts. In addition, iPSC can be generated from somatic cells harvested from normal individuals or patients, and used as a cellular tool to unravel mechanisms of human development and to model diseases in a manner not possible before. Besides these fundamental aspects of human biology and physiology that are revealed using iPSC or iPSC-derived cells, these cells hold an immense potential for cell-based therapies, and for the discovery of new or personalized pharmacological treatments for many disorders. Here, we review some of the current challenges and concerns about iPSC technology. We introduce the potential held by iPSC for research and development of novel health-related applications. We briefly present the efforts made by the scientific and clinical communities to create the necessary guidelines and regulations to achieve the highest quality standards in the procedures for iPSC generation, characterization and long-term preservation.

Several recent studies have reported direct conversion of human somatic cells into stably proliferating induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). Importantly, iNSCs are easier, faster, and more cost-efficient to generate than induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also have a higher level of clinical safety. Stably, self-renewing iNSCs can be derived from different cellular sources, such as skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and readily differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages that are indistinguishable from their iPSC-derived counterparts or from NSCs isolated from primary tissues. This review focuses on the derivation and characterization of iNSCs and their biomedical applications. We first outline different approaches to generate iNSCs and then discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, we summarize the preclinical validation of iNSCs to highlight that these cells are promising targets for disease modeling, autologous cell therapy, and precision medicine.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Anita Erharter, Sandra Rizzi, Jerome Mertens, Frank Edenhofer<br><b>Journal:</b> FEBS Lett.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1873-3468<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663609">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Molecular Mechanisms of Cardiac Remodeling and Regeneration in Physical Exercise.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Regular physical activity with aerobic and muscle-strengthening training protects against the occurrence and progression of cardiovascular disease and can improve cardiac function in heart failure patients.

Various intracellular mechanisms mediating these positive effects on cardiac function have been found in animal models of exercise and will be highlighted in this review. 1) activation of extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), EGFR/JNK/SP-1, nitric oxide (NO)-signaling, and extracellular vesicles; 2) gene expression modulation via microRNAs (miR), in particular via miR-17-3p and miR-222; and 3) modulation of cardiac cellular metabolism and mitochondrial adaption.

Glutamine is the most bountiful and flexible amino acid in the body which provides adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) demands for cells. Emerging evidences support that glutamine which acts as the second metabolic regulator after glucose exerts crucial roles in bone homeostasis at cellular level, including the lineage allocation and proliferation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), the matrix mineralization of osteoblasts, and the biosynthesis in chondrocytes. The integrated mechanism consisting of WNT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway in a glutamine-dependent pattern is responsible to regulate the complex intrinsic biological process, despite more extensive molecules are deserved to be elucidated in glutamine metabolism further. Indeed, dysfunctional glutamine metabolism enhances the development of degenerative bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, and glutamine or glutamine progenitor supplementation can partially restore bone defects which may promote treatment of bone diseases, although the mechanisms are not quite clear. In this review, we will summarize and update the latest research findings and clinical trials on the crucial regulatory roles of glutamine metabolism in BMSCs and BMSC-derived bone cells, also followed with the osteoclasts which are important in bone resorption.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Tao Zhou, Yuqing Yang, Qianming Chen, Liang Xie<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cells Int<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1687-966X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611919">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Protein Kinases and Their Inhibitors in Pluripotent Stem Cell Fate Regulation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Protein kinases modulate the reversible postmodifications of substrate proteins to their phosphorylated forms as an essential process in regulating intracellular signaling transduction cascades.

These defects cannot be corrected by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and thymus transplantation has not yet been demonstrated to be fully curative. Here, we provide proof of principle of a novel approach toward thymic regeneration, involving the generation of thymic organoids obtained by seeding gene-modified postnatal murine TECs into three-dimensional (3D) collagen type I scaffolds mimicking the thymic ultrastructure. To this end, freshly isolated TECs were transduced with a lentiviral vector system, allowing for doxycycline-induced Oct4 expression. Transient Oct4 expression promoted TECs expansion without drastically changing the cell lineage identity of adult TECs, which retain the expression of important molecules for thymus functionality such as Foxn1, Dll4, Dll1, and AIRE. Oct4-expressing TECs (iOCT4 TEC) were able to grow into 3D collagen type I scaffolds both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that the collagen structure reproduced a 3D environment similar to the thymic extracellular matrix, perfectly recognized by TECs. In vivo results showed that thymic organoids transplanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice were vascularized but failed to support thymopoiesis because of their limited in vivo persistence. These findings provide evidence that gene modification, in combination with the usage of 3D biomimetic scaffolds, may represent a novel approach allowing the use of postnatal TECs for thymic regeneration.

Ageing is a risk factor for IPF and incidence has been demonstrated to increase with age. Decreased (macro)autophagy with age has been reported extensively in a variety of systems and diseases, including IPF. However, it is undetermined whether the role of faulty autophagy is causal or coincidental in the context of IPF. Here, we report that in alveolar epithelial cells inhibition of autophagy promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process implicated in embryonic development, wound healing, cancer metastasis and fibrosis. We further demonstrate that this is attained, at least in part, by increased p62/SQSTM1 expression that promotes p65/RELA mediated-transactivation of an EMT transcription factor, Snail2 (SNAI2), which not only controls EMT but also regulates the production of locally acting profibrogenic mediators.

It was recently reported that Sirt1 overexpression in kidney tubule ameliorates cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). However, whether pharmacological activation of Sirt1 also has a beneficial effect against the disease remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether SRT1720, a potent and specific activator of Sirt1, could ameliorate cisplatin-induced AKI. We found that SRT1720 treatment ameliorated cisplatin-induced acute renal failure and histopathological alterations. Increased levels of tubular injury markers in kidneys were significantly attenuated by SRT1720. SRT1720 treatment also suppressed caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death. Increased expression of 4-hydroxynonenal, elevated malondialdehyde level, and decreased ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione after cisplatin injection were significantly reversed by SRT1720. In addition, SRT1720 treatment decreased renal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented macrophage infiltration into damaged kidneys. We also showed that the therapeutic effects of SRT1720 were associated with reduced acetylation of p53 and nuclear factor kappa-B p65 and preservation of peroxisome function, as evidenced by recovered expression of markers for number and function of peroxisome. These results suggest that Sirt1 activation by SRT1720 would be a useful therapeutic option for cisplatin-induced AKI.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Jung-Yeon Kim, Jungmin Jo, Kiryeong Kim, Hyun-Jin An, Mi-Gyeong Gwon, Hyemin Gu, Hyun-Ju Kim, A Young Yang, Sung-Woo Kim, Eon Ju Jeon, Jae-Hyung Park, Jaechan Leem, Kwan-Kyu Park<br><b>Journal:</b> Antioxidants (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2076-3921<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.61<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.113<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431003">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genetic conversion of proliferative astroglia into neurons after cerebral ischemia: a new therapeutic tool for the aged brain?<br><b>Abstract:</b> Ischemic stroke represents the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause for long-term disabilities, for which no cure exists. After stroke, neurons are frequently lost in the infarct core. On the other hand, other cells such as astrocytes become reactive and proliferative, disrupting the neurovascular unit in the lesioned area, especially in the aged brain. Therefore, restoring the balance between neurons and nonneuronal cells within the perilesional area is crucial for post stroke recovery. In addition, the aged post stroke brain mounts a fulminant proliferative astroglial response leading to the buildup of gliotic scars that prevent neural regeneration. Therefore, "melting" glial scars has been attempted for decades, albeit with little success. Alternative strategies include transforming inhibitory gliotic tissue into an environment conducive to neuronal regeneration and axonal growth by genetic conversion of astrocytes into neurons. The latter idea has gained momentum following the discovery that in vivo direct lineage reprogramming in the adult mammalian brain is a feasible strategy for reprogramming nonneuronal cells into neurons. This exciting new technology emerged as a new approach to circumvent cell transplantation for stroke therapy.

However, there are great challenges to investigate telocytes functions using primary telocytes, due to the difficulties of isolation, identification, and stability. The present study aims at constructing continuous cell strain of mouse lung telocyte cell line with stable characters by gene modification and investigating biological behaviors and responses of gene-modified telocytes to inflammation.
METHODS: Mouse primary lung telocytes were isolated and identified using immune-labeling markers and immunoelectron microscopy. Primary telocytes were transformed with Simian vacuolating virus 40 small and large T antigen (SV40). Biological characters, behaviors morphology, and proliferation of those gene-modified telocytes were defined and monitored dynamically for 50 generations, as compared with primary lung telocytes. Cell cycle of mouse primary lung telocytes or gene-modified telocytes was detected by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Gene modified telocytes of generations 5, 10, 30 and 50 were observed with telopodes and also showed CD34 and ckit positive. Multiple cellular morphology were also observed on telocyte cell-line under monitor of celliq and enhanced cell proliferation were showed. SV40 transduction was also reduced apoptosis and increased the ratio of S and G2 phases in telocyte cell-line.
CONCLUSION: We successfully constructed mouse lung telocyte cell-line which maintained the biological properties and behaviors as primary telocytes and could responses to inflammation induced by LPS. Thus, gene-modified lung telocytes, Telocyte Line, would provide a cell tool for researchers exploring the roles and applications of telocytes involved in physiological and pathological states in future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Dongli Song, Menglin Xu, Ruixue Qi, Ruihua Ma, Yile Zhou, Duojiao Wu, Hao Fang, Xiangdong Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> J Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1479-5876<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.20<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.591<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092264">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mitochondrial plasticity in cell fate regulation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Mitochondria are considered highly plastic organelles.

Despite decades of intense research and over 50 potentially causative or disease-modifying genes identified, etiology remains unexplained and treatment options remain limited for the majority of ALS patients. Various factors have contributed to the slow progress in understanding and developing therapeutics for this disease. Here, we review the genetic basis of ALS, highlighting factors that have contributed to the elusiveness of genetic heritability. The most commonly mutated ALS-linked genes are reviewed with an emphasis on disease-causing mechanisms.

The most important factors capable of significantly affecting the cellular environment are the amount and quality of nutrients available. Mitochondria are both involved in the production of some of the molecules capable of directly affecting the epigenome and have a critical role in the conversion of nutrients into usable energy. Carbohydrate and fats are converted into ATP, acetyl-CoA, SAM, and NADH. These high-energy substrates are, in turn, capable of driving the epigenetic profile. We describe substances capable of affecting this mechanism. On the other hand, nutritional interventions capable of reducing calories or significantly impairing the normal Acetyl-CoA production or the SAM-SAH ratio also impact chromatin methylation and histone modification, suggesting a critical role of mitochondria on nutrient-dependent epigenetic profile.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Giusi Taormina, Antonio Russo, Mario A Latteri, Mario G Mirisola<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-2392<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.63<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.344<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636605">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Absence of an embryonic stem cell DNA methylation signature in human cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Differentiated cells that arise from stem cells in early development contain DNA methylation features that provide a memory trace of their fetal cell origin (FCO). The FCO signature was developed to estimate the proportion of cells in a mixture of cell types that are of fetal origin and are reminiscent of embryonic stem cell lineage. Here we implemented the FCO signature estimation method to compare the fraction of cells with the FCO signature in tumor tissues and their corresponding nontumor normal tissues.
METHODS: We applied our FCO algorithm to discovery data sets obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and replication data sets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Wilcoxon rank sum tests, linear regression models with adjustments for potential confounders and non-parametric randomization-based tests were used to test the association of FCO proportion between tumor tissues and nontumor normal tissues. P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Across 20 different tumor types we observed a consistently lower FCO signature in tumor tissues compared with nontumor normal tissues, with 18 observed to have significantly lower FCO fractions in tumor tissue (total n = 6,795 tumor, n = 922 nontumor, P < 0.05). We replicated our findings in 15 tumor types using data from independent subjects in 15 publicly available data sets (total n = 740 tumor, n = 424 nontumor, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cancer development itself is substantially devoid of recapitulation of normal embryologic processes. Our results emphasize the distinction between DNA methylation in normal tightly regulated stem cell driven differentiation and cancer stem cell reprogramming that involves altered methylation in the service of great cell heterogeneity and plasticity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Ze Zhang, John K Wiencke, Devin C Koestler, Lucas A Salas, Brock C Christensen, Karl T Kelsey<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Cancer<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2407<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.03<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.336<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324166">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Insights from deconvolution of cell subtype proportions enhance the interpretation of functional genomic data.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cell subtype proportion variability between samples contributes significantly to the variation of functional genomic properties such as gene expression or DNA methylation. Although the impact of the variation of cell subtype composition on measured genomic quantities is recognized, and some innovative tools have been developed for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, most functional genomics studies using samples with mixed cell types still ignore the influence of cell subtype proportion variation, or just deal with it as a nuisance variable to be eliminated. Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data can provide insights into cellular changes associated with phenotypes. We focused on two types of mixed cell populations, human blood and mouse kidney. Cell type prediction is well developed in the former, but not currently in the latter. Estimating the cellular repertoire is easier when a reference dataset from purified samples of all cell types in the tissue is available, as is the case for blood. However, reference datasets are not available for most other tissues, such as the kidney. In this study, we showed that the proportion of alterations attributable to changes in the cellular composition varies strikingly in the two disorders (asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that the contribution of cell subtype proportion changes to functional genomic properties can be disease-specific. We also showed that a reference dataset from a single-cell RNA-seq study successfully estimated the cell subtype proportions in mouse kidney and allowed us to distinguish altered cell subtype differences between two different knock-out mouse models, both of which had reported a reduced number of glomeruli compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings demonstrate that testing for changes in cell subtype proportions between conditions can yield important insights in functional genomics studies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Yu Kong, Deepa Rastogi, Cathal Seoighe, John M Greally, Masako Suzuki<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022271">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Brain organoids and insights on human evolution.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Human brain organoids, generated from pluripotent stem cells, have emerged as a promising technique for modeling early stages of human neurodevelopment in controlled laboratory conditions.

In 2006, researchers Takahashi and Yamanaka developed an alternative method of generating embryonic-like stem cells from adult cells, which they coined induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Such iPSCs possess most of the advantages of embryonic stem cells without the ethical stigma associated with derivation of the latter. The possibility of generating "custom-made" pluripotent cells, ideal for patient-specific disease models, alongside their possible applications in regenerative medicine and reproduction, has drawn a lot of attention to the field with numbers of iPSC studies published growing exponentially. IPSCs have now been generated for a wide variety of species, including but not limited to, mouse, human, primate, wild felines, bovines, equines, birds and rodents, some of which still lack well-established embryonic stem cell lines. The paucity of robust characterization of some of these iPSC lines as well as the residual expression of transgenes involved in the reprogramming process still hampers the use of such cells in species preservation or medical research, underscoring the requirement for further investigations.

Fortunately, sparked by the genetic revolution, stem cell reprogramming research and the advancing capabilities of personalization in medicine enable forward-thinking to unprecedented patient-specific modeling and cell therapies for Parkinson's disease using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In addition to modeling Parkinson's disease more accurately than chemically-induced animal models, patient-specific stem cell lines can be created, elucidating the effects of genetic susceptibility and sub-populations' differing responses to in vitro treatments. Sourcing cell therapy with iPSC lines provides ethical advantages because these stem cell lines do not require the sacrifice of human zygotes and genetically-specific drug trails can be tested in vitro without lasting damage to patients. In hopes of finally slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease or re-establishing function, iPSC lines can ultimately be corrected with gene therapy and used as cell sources for neural transplantation for Parkinson's disease. With relatively localized neural degeneration, similar to spinal column injury, Parkinson's disease presents a better candidacy for cell therapy when compared to other diffuse degeneration found in Alzheimer's or Huntington's Disease. Neurosurgical implantation of pluripotent cells poses the risk of an innate immune response and tumorigenesis. Precautions, therefore, must be taken to ensure cell line quality before transplantation. While cell quality can be quantified using a number of assays, a yielding a high percentage of therapeutically relevant dopaminergic neurons, minimal de novo genetic mutations, and standard chromosomal structure is of the utmost importance. Current techniques focus on iPSCs because they can be matched with donors using human leukocyte antigens, thereby reducing the severity and risk of immune rejection. In August of 2018, researchers in Kyoto, Japan embarked on the first human clinical trial using iPSC cell therapy transplantation for patients with moderate Parkinson's disease. Transplantation of many cell sources has already proven to reduce Parkinson's disease symptoms in mouse and primate models.

Recent advances in gene editing technology have enabled increasingly rapid understanding of gene sequence variation and gene regulatory function in the central nervous system. Moreover, these tools have provided new insights into the locus-specific functions of epigenetic modifications and enabled epigenetic editing at specific gene loci in disease contexts. Continued development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based tools has provided not only cell-specific modulation, but also rapid induction profiles that permit sophisticated interrogation of the temporal dynamics that contribute to brain health and disease. This review summarizes recent advances in genetic editing, transcriptional modulation, and epigenetic reorganization, with a focus on applications to neuronal systems and potential uses in brain disorders characterized by genetic sequence variation or transcriptional dysregulation. .<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy J Day<br><b>Journal:</b> Dialogues Clin Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1958-5969<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949403">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1 has a role in the translational response to TORC1 inhibition.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Ded1 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase with essential roles in translation initiation.

These lineage-committed stem and progenitor cells give rise to all adult tissues and organs. Adult stem and progenitor cells are generated as part of the developmental program and play critical roles in tissue and organ maintenance and/or regeneration. The ability of pluripotent stem cells to self-renew, maintain pluripotency, and differentiate into a multicellular organism is highly dependent on sensing and integrating extracellular and extraorganismal cues. Proteins perform and integrate almost all cellular functions including signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, metabolism, and cell division and death. Therefore, maintenance of an appropriate mix of correctly folded proteins, a pristine proteome, is essential for proper stem cell function. The stem cells' proteome must be pristine because unfolded, misfolded, or otherwise damaged proteins would interfere with unlimited self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency, differentiation into downstream lineages, and consequently with the development of properly functioning tissue and organs. Understanding how various stem cells generate and maintain a pristine proteome is therefore essential for exploiting their potential in regenerative medicine and possibly for the discovery of novel approaches for maintaining, propagating, and differentiating pluripotent, multipotent, and adult stem cells as well as induced pluripotent stem cells. In this review, we will summarize cellular networks used by various stem cells for generation and maintenance of a pristine proteome. We will also explore the coordination of these networks with one another and their integration with the gene regulatory and signaling networks.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Bertal H Aktas, Berin Upcin, Erik Henke, Manju Padmasekar, Xuebin Qin, Süleyman Ergün<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cells Int<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1687-966X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191665">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MYC competes with MiT/TFE in regulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy through an epigenetic rheostat.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Coordinated regulation of the lysosomal and autophagic systems ensures basal catabolism and normal cell physiology, and failure of either system causes disease. Here we describe an epigenetic rheostat orchestrated by c-MYC and histone deacetylases that inhibits lysosomal and autophagic biogenesis by concomitantly repressing the expression of the transcription factors MiT/TFE and FOXH1, and that of lysosomal and autophagy genes. Inhibition of histone deacetylases abates c-MYC binding to the promoters of lysosomal and autophagy genes, granting promoter occupancy to the MiT/TFE members, TFEB and TFE3, and/or the autophagy regulator FOXH1. In pluripotent stem cells and cancer, suppression of lysosomal and autophagic function is directly downstream of c-MYC overexpression and may represent a hallmark of malignant transformation. We propose that, by determining the fate of these catabolic systems, this hierarchical switch regulates the adaptive response of cells to pathological and physiological cues that could be exploited therapeutically.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Ida Annunziata, Diantha van de Vlekkert, Elmar Wolf, David Finkelstein, Geoffrey Neale, Eda Machado, Rosario Mosca, Yvan Campos, Heather Tillman, Martine F Roussel, Jason Andrew Weesner, Leigh Ellen Fremuth, Xiaohui Qiu, Min-Joon Han, Gerard C Grosveld, Alessandra d'Azzo<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399583">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The transcription factor Slug represses p16<br><b>Abstract:</b> Activation of the p16<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Pei Zhu, Chunping Zhang, Yongxing Gao, Furen Wu, Yalu Zhou, Wen-Shu Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189923">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Loci for human leukocyte telomere length in the Singaporean Chinese population and trans-ethnic genetic studies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Genetic factors underlying leukocyte telomere length (LTL) may provide insights into telomere homeostasis, with direct links to disease susceptibility.

Thus, studying pathogenetic mechanisms underlying SCZ requires studying the development of brain cells. Cortical interneurons (cINs) are consistently observed to be abnormal in SCZ postmortem brains. These abnormalities may explain altered gamma oscillation and cognitive function in patients with SCZ. Of note, currently used antipsychotic drugs ameliorate psychosis, but they are not very effective in reversing cognitive deficits. Characterizing mechanisms of SCZ pathogenesis, especially related to cognitive deficits, may lead to improved treatments. We generated homogeneous populations of developing cINs from 15 healthy control (HC) iPSC lines and 15 SCZ iPSC lines. SCZ cINs, but not SCZ glutamatergic neurons, show dysregulated Oxidative Phosphorylation (OxPhos) related gene expression, accompanied by compromised mitochondrial function. The OxPhos deficit in cINs could be reversed by Alpha Lipoic Acid/Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALA/ALC) but not by other chemicals previously identified as increasing mitochondrial function. The restoration of mitochondrial function by ALA/ALC was accompanied by a reversal of arborization deficits in SCZ cINs.

AxD iPSC-astrocytes accumulated pSer13-GFAP in cytoplasmic aggregates within deep nuclear invaginations, resembling the hallmark Rosenthal fibers observed in vivo. Ser13 phosphorylation facilitated GFAP aggregation and was associated with increased GFAP proteolysis by caspase-6. Furthermore, caspase-6 was selectively expressed in young AxD patients, and correlated with the presence of cleaved GFAP. We reveal a novel PTM signature linking different GFAP mutations in infantile AxD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Rachel A Battaglia, Adriana S Beltran, Samed Delic, Raluca Dumitru, Jasmine A Robinson, Parijat Kabiraj, Laura E Herring, Victoria J Madden, Namritha Ravinder, Erik Willems, Rhonda A Newman, Roy A Quinlan, James E Goldman, Ming-Der Perng, Masaki Inagaki, Natasha T Snider<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682229">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> TERRA regulate the transcriptional landscape of pluripotent cells through TRF1-dependent recruitment of PRC2.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The mechanisms that regulate pluripotency are still largely unknown. Here, we show that Telomere Repeat Binding Factor 1 (TRF1), a component of the shelterin complex, regulates the genome-wide binding of polycomb and polycomb H3K27me3 repressive marks to pluripotency genes, thereby exerting vast epigenetic changes that contribute to the maintenance of mouse ES cells in a naïve state. We further show that TRF1 mediates these effects by regulating TERRA, the lncRNAs transcribed from telomeres. We find that TERRAs are enriched at polycomb and stem cell genes in pluripotent cells and that TRF1 abrogation results in increased TERRA levels and in higher TERRA binding to those genes, coincidental with the induction of cell-fate programs and the loss of the naïve state. These results are consistent with a model in which TRF1-dependent changes in TERRA levels modulate polycomb recruitment to pluripotency and differentiation genes. These unprecedented findings explain why TRF1 is essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Rosa María Marión, Juan J Montero, Isabel López de Silanes, Osvaldo Graña-Castro, Paula Martínez, Stefan Schoeftner, José Alejandro Palacios-Fábrega, Maria A Blasco<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426913">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The transcription factor Hey and nuclear lamins specify and maintain cell identity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The inability of differentiated cells to maintain their identity is a hallmark of age-related diseases.

Exposure to environmental factors such as nutrition, climate, stress, pathogens, toxins, and even social behavior during gametogenesis and early embryogenesis has been shown to influence disease susceptibility in the offspring. Early-life epigenetic modifications, which determine the expression of genetic information stored in the genome, are viewed as one of the general mechanisms linking prenatal exposure and phenotypic changes later in life. From atmospheric pollution, endocrine-disrupting chemicals to heavy metals, research increasingly suggests that environmental pollutions have already produced significant consequences on human health. Moreover, mounting evidence now links such pollution to relevant modification in the epigenome. The epigenetics diet, referring to a class of bioactive dietary compounds such as isothiocyanates in broccoli, genistein in soybean, resveratrol in grape, epigallocatechin-3-gallate in green tea, and ascorbic acid in fruits, has been shown to modify the epigenome leading to beneficial health outcomes. This review will primarily focus on the causes and consequences of prenatal environment pollution exposure on the epigenome, and the potential protective role of the epigenetics diet, which could play a central role in neutralizing epigenomic aberrations against environmental pollutions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Shizhao Li, Min Chen, Yuanyuan Li, Trygve O Tollefsbol<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin Epigenetics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1868-7083<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.43<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.426<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31097039">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Oxidative DNA Damage Signalling in Neural Stem Cells in Alzheimer's Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The main pathological symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Marcelina Kieroń, Cezary Żekanowski, Anna Falk, Michalina Wężyk<br><b>Journal:</b> Oxid Med Cell Longev<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1942-0994<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.58<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.388<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31814869">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Human Monocyte Subsets and Phenotypes in Major Chronic Inflammatory Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Human monocytes are divided in three major populations; classical (CD14<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Theodore S Kapellos, Lorenzo Bonaguro, Ioanna Gemünd, Nico Reusch, Adem Saglam, Emily R Hinkley, Joachim L Schultze<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543877">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunocyte Profiling Using Single-Cell Mass Cytometry Reveals EpCAM<br><b>Abstract:</b> Colon cancer (CC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related mortality.

Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq regions with scRNA-seq genes that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process.

'cannabinoid exposure and altered DNA methylation in rat and human sperm' epigenetics 2018; 13: 1208-1221.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Recent data from the Kollins lab ('Cannabinoid exposure and altered DNA methylation in rat and human sperm' Epigenetics 2018; 13: 1208-1221) indicated epigenetic effects of cannabis use on sperm in man parallel those in rats and showed substantial shifts in both hypo- and hyper-DNA methylation with the latter predominating. This provides one likely mechanism for the transgenerational transmission of epigenomic instability with sperm as the vector. It therefore contributes important pathophysiological insights into the probable mechanisms underlying the epidemiology of prenatal cannabis exposure potentially explaining diverse features of cannabis-related teratology including effects on the neuraxis, cardiovasculature, immune stimulation, secondary genomic instability and carcinogenesis related to both adult and pediatric cancers. The potentially inheritable and therefore multigenerational nature of these defects needs to be carefully considered in the light of recent teratological and neurobehavioural trends in diverse jurisdictions such as the USA nationally, Hawaii, Colorado, Canada, France and Australia, particularly relating to mental retardation, age-related morbidity and oncogenesis including inheritable cancerogenesis. Increasing demonstrations that the epigenome can respond directly and in real time and retain memories of environmental exposures of many kinds implies that the genome-epigenome is much more sensitive to environmental toxicants than has been generally realized. Issues of long-term multigenerational inheritance amplify these concerns.

Thus, an enhanced metabolism is needed in order to accommodate tumor cells' accelerated biological functions, including increased proliferation, vigorous migration during metastasis, and adaptation to different tissues from the primary invasion site. In this context, the assessment of tumor cell metabolic pathways generates crucial data pertaining to the mechanisms through which tumor cells survive and grow in a milieu of host defense mechanisms. Indeed, various studies have demonstrated that the metabolic signature of tumors is heterogeneous. Furthermore, these metabolic changes induce the exacerbated production of several molecules, which result in alterations that aid an inflammatory milieu. The therapeutic armentarium for oncology should thus include metabolic and inflammation regulators.

Global CRC burden is expected to increase by 60% in the next decade, with low-income countries experiencing an escalation of CRC incidence and mortality in parallel to the adoption of western lifestyles. CRC incidence is also sharply increasing in individuals younger than 50 years, often presenting at advanced stages and with aggressive features. Both genetic and environmental factors have been recognized as major contributors for the development of CRC, the latter including diet-related conditions such as chronic inflammation and obesity. In particular, a diet rich in fat and sugars (Western-style diet, WSD) has been shown to induce multiple pathophysiological changes in the intestine linked to an increased risk of CRC. In this scenario, dietary factors have been recently shown to play novel unexpected roles in the regulation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and of the gut microbiota, which represent the two main biological systems responsible for intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, diet is increasingly recognized to play a key role in the neoplastic transformation of ISCs and in the metabolic regulation of colorectal cancer stem cells. This review illustrates novel discoveries on the role of dietary components in regulating intestinal homeostasis and colorectal tumorigenesis. Particular focus is dedicated to new areas of research with potential clinical relevance including the effect of food components on ISCs and cancer stem cells (CSCs), the existence of CRC-specific microbial signatures and the alterations of intestinal homeostasis potentially involved in early-onset CRC. New insights on the role of dietary factors in intestinal regulation will provide new tools not only for the prevention and early diagnosis of CRC but also for improving the effectiveness of current CRC therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Federica Francescangeli, Maria Laura De Angelis, Ann Zeuner<br><b>Journal:</b> Nutrients<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6643<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.493<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816977">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A Low Iron Diet Protects from Steatohepatitis in a Mouse Model.<br><b>Abstract:</b> High tissue iron levels are a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To investigate causal relationships and underlying mechanisms, we used an established NAFLD model-mice fed a high fat diet with supplemental fructose in the water ("fast food", FF). Iron did not affect excess hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mice on FF, and FF did not affect iron accumulation compared to normal chow. Mice on low iron are protected from worsening of markers for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including serum transaminases and fibrotic gene transcript levels. These occurred prior to the onset of significant insulin resistance or changes in adipokines. Transcriptome sequencing revealed the major effects of iron to be on signaling by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, a known mechanistic factor in NASH. High iron increased fibrotic gene expression in vitro, demonstrating that the effect of dietary iron on NASH is direct.

We analysed single-cell (sc) microarray transcriptomics data from E3.25 using Hierarchical Optimal k-Means (HOkM) clustering, and identified two groups of ICM cells: a group of cells from embryos with less than 34 cells (E3.25-LNCs), and another group of cells from embryos with more than 33 cells (E3.25-HNCs), corresponding to two developmental stages. Although we found massive underlying heterogeneity in the ICM cells at E3.25-HNC with over 3,800 genes with transcriptomics bifurcation, many of which are PE and EPI markers, we showed that the E3.25-HNCs are neither PE nor EPI. Importantly, analysing the differently expressed genes between the E3.25-LNCs and E3.25-HNCs, we uncovered a non-autonomous mechanism, based on a minimal number of four inner-cell contacts in the ICM, which activates Oct4 in the preimplantation embryo. Oct4 is highly expressed but unstable at E3.25-LNC, and stabilizes at high level at E3.25-HNC, with Bsg highly expressed, and the chromatin remodelling program initialised to establish an early naïve pluripotent state. Our results indicate that the pluripotent state we found to exist in the ICM at E3.25-HNC is the in vivo counterpart of a new, very early pluripotent state. We compared the transcriptomics profile of this in vivo E3.25-HNC pluripotent state, together with the profiles of E3.25-LNC, E3.5 EPI and E4.5 EPI cells, with the profiles of all embryonic stem cells (ESCs) available in the GEO database from the same platform (over 600 microarrays). The shortest distance between the set of inner cells (E3.25, E3.5 and E4.5) and the ESCs is between the E3.25-HNC cells and 2i + LIF ESCs; thus, the developmental transition from 33 to 34 cells decreases dramatically the distance with the naïve ground state of the 2i + LIF ESCs.

In this study, we retrieved 2742 articles from the PubMed database from 2013 to 2018 using "Neural Stem Cells" as the retrieval word. Co-word analysis was conducted to statistically quantify the characteristics and popular themes of human neural stem cell-related studies. Bibliographic data matrices were generated with the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder. We identified 78 high-frequency Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. A visual matrix was built with the repeated bisection method in gCLUTO software. A social network analysis network was generated with Ucinet 6.0 software and GraphPad Prism 5 software. The analyses demonstrated that in the 6-year period, hot topics were clustered into five categories. As suggested by the constructed strategic diagram, studies related to cytology and physiology were well-developed, whereas those related to neural stem cell applications, tissue engineering, metabolism and cell signaling, and neural stem cell pathology and virology remained immature. Neural stem cell therapy for stroke and Parkinson's disease, the genetics of microRNAs and brain neoplasms, as well as neuroprotective agents, Zika virus, Notch receptor, neural crest and embryonic stem cells were identified as emerging hot spots.

Not only does this halt the human body's reparative processes after central nervous system lesions, but it also impedes the establishment of effective and safe therapeutic options for such patients. Despite the high prevalence of stroke and spinal cord injury in the general population, these conditions remain incurable and place a heavy burden on patients' families and on society more broadly. Neuroregeneration and neural engineering are diverse biomedical fields that attempt reparative treatments, utilizing stem cells-based strategies, biologically active molecules, nanotechnology, exosomes and highly tunable biodegradable systems (e.g., certain hydrogels). Although there are studies demonstrating promising preclinical results, safe clinical translation has not yet been accomplished. A key gap in clinical translation is the absence of an ideal animal or ex vivo model that can perfectly simulate the human microenvironment, and also correspond to all the complex pathophysiological and neuroanatomical factors that affect functional outcomes in humans after central nervous system injury. Such an ideal model does not currently exist, but it seems that the nonhuman primate model is uniquely qualified for this role, given its close resemblance to humans. This review considers some regenerative therapies for central nervous system repair that hold promise for future clinical translation. In addition, it attempts to uncover some of the main reasons why clinical translation might fail without the implementation of nonhuman primate models in the research pipeline.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Magdalini Tsintou, Kyriakos Dalamagkas, Nikos Makris<br><b>Journal:</b> Neural Regen Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1673-5374<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.39<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.674<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571651">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Cancer Microbiota: EMT and Inflammation as Shared Molecular Mechanisms Associated with Plasticity and Progression.<br><b>Abstract:</b> With the advent of novel molecular platforms for high-throughput/next-generation sequencing, the communities of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the human body have been defined in depth. In the last decade, the role of microbiota-host interactions in driving human cancer plasticity and malignant progression has been well documented. Germ-free preclinical models provided an invaluable tool to demonstrate that the human microbiota can confer susceptibility to various types of cancer and can also modulate the host response to therapeutic treatments. Of interest, besides the detrimental effects of dysbiosis on cancer etiopathogenesis, specific microorganisms have been shown to exert protective activities against cancer growth. This has strong clinical implications, as restoration of the physiologic microbiota is being rapidly implemented as a novel anticancer therapeutic strategy. Here, we reviewed past and recent literature depicting the role of microbiota-host interactions in modulating key molecular mechanisms that drive human cancer plasticity and lead to malignant progression. We analyzed microbiota-host interactions occurring in the gut as well as in other anatomic sites, such as oral and nasal cavities, lungs, breast, esophagus, stomach, reproductive tract, and skin. We revealed a common ground of biological alterations and pathways modulated by a dysbiotic microbiota and potentially involved in the control of cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms most frequently affected by the pathogenic microorganisms to induce malignant progression involve epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) dependent barrier alterations and tumor-promoting inflammation. This evidence may pave the way to better stratify high-risk cancer patients based on unique microenvironmental/microbial signatures and to develop novel, personalized, biological therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Vergara, Pasquale Simeone, Marina Damato, Michele Maffia, Paola Lanuti, Marco Trerotola<br><b>Journal:</b> J Oncol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1687-8450<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.26<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.087<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772577">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Head and neck cancer management and cancer stem cells implication.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) arise in the mucosal linings of the upper aerodigestive tract and are heterogeneous in nature. Risk factors for HNSCCs are smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and the human papilloma virus. Conventional treatments are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combined modality; however, no international standard mode of therapy exists. In contrast to the conventional model of clonal evolution in tumor development, there is a newly proposed theory based on the activity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as the model for carcinogenesis. This "CSC hypothesis" may explain the high mortality rate, low response to treatments, and tendency to develop multiple tumors for HNSCC patients. We review current knowledge on HNSCC etiology and treatment, with a focus on CSCs, including their origins, identifications, and effects on therapeutic options.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Osama A Elkashty, Ramy Ashry, Simon D Tran<br><b>Journal:</b> Saudi Dent J<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1013-9052<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.50<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.458<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31700218">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> miR-448 promotes progression of non-small-cell lung cancer via targeting SIRT1.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Deregulation of microRNAs (miRs) has been demonstrated to be involved in both the initiation and the development of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). miR-448 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several cancer types. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of miR-448 in NSCLC. Tumor tissues and paired normal tissues were obtained from patients with NSCLC. The viability and migration of A549 cells were determined by the Cell Counting kit-8 and wound-healing assays, respectively. Gene and protein levels were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blotting, respectively. The interaction between the 3' untranslated region of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and miR-448 was predicted by TargetScan and verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. miR-448 levels were revealed to be decreased whereas SIRT1 levels were increased in NSCLC tissues compared with normal tissues. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that there was a negative correlation between miR-448 and SIRT1 mRNA levels. Overexpression of miR-448 led to reduced growth and migration ability of A549 cells. In addition, overexpression of miR-448 decreased SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels, thereby inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and affecting EMT-associated molecules, including vimentin and E-cadherin. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that SIRT1 was a direct target of miR-448. Notably, activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol treatment partially reversed the cell growth inhibition induced by miR-448 mimics. These findings suggested that the progression of NSCLC may be controlled by miR-448, which appears to hold promise as a therapeutic target for patients with NSCLC.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Hongfeng Qi, Haifeng Wang, Dabin Pang<br><b>Journal:</b> Exp Ther Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1792-0981<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.49<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.488<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410153">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Increased Neuronal Differentiation Efficiency in High Cell Density-Derived Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), provide access to hard-to-obtain cells for studies under physiological and disease conditions. For the study of neurodegenerative diseases, especially sporadic cases where the "disease condition" might be restricted towards the neuroectodermal lineage, obtaining the affected neurons is important to help unravel the underlying molecular mechanism leading to the diseases. Although differentiation of iPSCs to neural lineage allows acquisition of cell types of interest, the technology suffers from low efficiency leading to low yield of neurons. Here, we investigated the potential of adult neuroprogenitor cells (aNPCs) for iPSC derivation and possible confounders such as cell density of infected NPCs on their subsequent neuronal differentiation potential from reprogrammed cells under isogenic conditions. Characterized hiPSCs of defined cell densities generated from aNPCs were subjected to neuronal differentiation on PA6 stromal cells.

Dynamin-related protein 1 is one of the evolutionarily highly conserved large family of GTPase proteins. Drp1 is critical for mitochondrial division, size, shape, and distribution throughout the neuron, from cell body to axons, dendrites, and nerve terminals. Several decades of intense research from several groups revealed that Drp1 is enriched at neuronal terminals and involved in synapse formation and synaptic sprouting. Different phosphorylated forms of Drp1 acts as both increased fragmentation and/or increased fusion of mitochondria. Increased levels of Drp1 were found in diseased states and caused excessive fragmentation of mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage. In the last two decades, several Drp1 inhibitors have been developed, including Mdivi-1, Dynasore, P110, and DDQ and their beneficial effects tested using cell cultures and mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent research using genetic crossing studies revealed that a partial reduction of Drp1 is protective against mutant protein(s)-induced mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities. Based on findings from cell cultures, mouse models and postmortem brains of AD and other neurodegenerative disease, we cautiously conclude that reduced Drp1 is a promising therapeutic target for AD and other neurological diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Darryll Oliver, P Hemachandra Reddy<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450774">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells : Clinical Significance and Applications in Neurologic Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells using gene transfer opens new areas for precision medicine with personalized cell therapy and encourages the discovery of essential platforms for targeted drug development. iPSCs retain the genome of the donor, may regenerate indefinitely, and undergo differentiation into virtually any cell type of interest using a range of published protocols.

Due to its avascular, aneural and non-lymphatic features, cartilage has limited self-regenerative properties. To date, the utilization of biomaterials to aid in cartilage regeneration, especially through the use of injectable scaffolds, has attracted considerable attention. Various materials, therapeutics and fabrication approaches have emerged with a focus on manipulating the cartilage microenvironment to induce the formation of cartilaginous structures that have similar properties to the native tissues. In particular, the design and fabrication of injectable hydrogel-based scaffolds have advanced in recent years with the aim of enhancing its therapeutic efficacy and improving its ease of administration. This review summarizes recent progress in these efforts, including the structural improvement of scaffolds, network cross-linking techniques and strategies for controlled release, which present new opportunities for the development of injectable scaffolds for cartilage regeneration.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Li, Guojun Chen, Xingquan Xu, Peter Abdou, Qing Jiang, Dongquan Shi, Zhen Gu<br><b>Journal:</b> Regen Biomater<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2056-3418<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.00<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.231<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198581">Link</a></b><br><br><br><a name="companies"></a><h2>Companies</h2> <br><br><br><a name="patents"></a><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficient method for reprogramming blood to induced pluripotent stem cells<br><b>Abstract:</b> Described herein are methods and compositions related to generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
