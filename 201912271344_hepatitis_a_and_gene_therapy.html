Identification of molecular drivers is hampered by the lack of suitable animal models. By performing RNA sequencing in livers from patients with different phenotypes of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), we show that development of AH is characterized by defective activity of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs). TGFβ1 is a key upstream transcriptome regulator in AH and induces the use of HNF4α P2 promoter in hepatocytes, which results in defective metabolic and synthetic functions. Gene polymorphisms in LETFs including HNF4α are not associated with the development of AH. In contrast, epigenetic studies show that AH livers have profound changes in DNA methylation state and chromatin remodeling, affecting HNF4α-dependent gene expression. We conclude that targeting TGFβ1 and epigenetic drivers that modulate HNF4α-dependent gene expression could be beneficial to improve hepatocellular function in patients with AH.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Josepmaria Argemi, Maria U Latasa, Stephen R Atkinson, Ilya O Blokhin, Veronica Massey, Joel P Gue, Joaquin Cabezas, Juan J Lozano, Derek Van Booven, Aaron Bell, Sheng Cao, Lawrence A Vernetti, Juan P Arab, Meritxell Ventura-Cots, Lia R Edmunds, Constantino Fondevilla, Peter Stärkel, Laurent Dubuquoy, Alexandre Louvet, Gemma Odena, Juan L Gomez, Tomas Aragon, Jose Altamirano, Juan Caballeria, Michael J Jurczak, D Lansing Taylor, Carmen Berasain, Claes Wahlestedt, Satdarshan P Monga, Marsha Y Morgan, Pau Sancho-Bru, Philippe Mathurin, Shinji Furuya, Carolin Lackner, Ivan Rusyn, Vijay H Shah, Mark R Thursz, Jelena Mann, Matias A Avila, Ramon Bataller<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311938">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunotherapeutic Challenges for Pediatric Cancers.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Solid tumors contain a mixture of malignant cells and non-malignant infiltrating cells that often create a chronic inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment that restricts immunotherapeutic approaches. Although childhood and adult cancers share some similarities related to microenvironmental changes, pediatric cancers are unique, and adult cancer practices may not be wholly applicable to our pediatric patients. This review highlights the differences in tumorigenesis, viral infection, and immunologic response between children and adults that need to be considered when trying to apply experiences from experimental therapies in adult cancer patients to pediatric cancers.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hutzen, Mohammed Ghonime, Joel Lee, Elaine R Mardis, Ruoning Wang, Dean A Lee, Mitchell S Cairo, Ryan D Roberts, Timothy P Cripe, Kevin A Cassady<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Oncolytics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2372-7705<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.65<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.753<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650024">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Heterologous Immunity: Role in Natural and Vaccine-Induced Resistance to Infections.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The central paradigm of vaccination is to generate resistance to infection by a specific pathogen when the vacinee is re-exposed to that pathogen. This paradigm is based on two fundamental characteristics of the adaptive immune system, specificity and memory. These characteristics come from the clonal specificity of T and B cells and the long-term survival of previously-encountered memory cells which can rapidly and specifically expand upon re-exposure to the same specific antigen. However, there is an increasing awareness of the concept, as well as experimental documentation of, heterologous immunity and cross-reactivity of adaptive immune lymphocytes in protection from infection. This awareness is supported by a number of human epidemiological studies in vaccine recipients and/or individuals naturally-resistant to certain infections, as well as studies in mouse models of infections, and indeed theoretical considerations regarding the disproportional repertoire of available T and B cell clonotypes compared to antigenic epitopes found on pathogens. Heterologous immunity can broaden the protective outcomes of vaccinations, and natural resistance to infections. Besides exogenous microbes/pathogens and/or vaccines, endogenous microbiota can also impact the outcomes of an infection and/or vaccination through heterologous immunity. Moreover, utilization of viral and/or bacterial vaccine vectors, capable of inducing heterologous immunity may also influence the natural course of many infections/diseases. This review article will briefly discuss these implications and redress the central dogma of specificity in the immune system.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Babita Agrawal<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781118">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Liver-Mediated Adaptive Immune Tolerance.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The liver is an immunologically tolerant organ that is uniquely equipped to limit hypersensitivity to food-derived antigens and bacterial products through the portal vein and can feasibly accept liver allografts. The adaptive immune response is a major branch of the immune system that induces organ/tissue-localized and systematic responses against pathogens and tumors while promoting self-tolerance. Persistent infection of the liver with a virus or other pathogen typically results in tolerance, which is a key feature of the liver. The liver's immunosuppressive microenvironment means that hepatic adaptive immune cells become readily tolerogenic, promoting the death of effector cells and the "education" of regulatory cells. The above mechanisms may result in the clonal deletion, exhaustion, or inhibition of peripheral T cells, which are key players in the adaptive immune response. These tolerance mechanisms are believed to be responsible for almost all liver diseases. However, optimal protective adaptive immune responses may be achieved through checkpoint immunotherapy and the modulation of hepatic innate immune cells in the host. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms involved in hepatic adaptive immune tolerance, the liver diseases caused thereby, and the therapeutic strategies needed to overcome this tolerance.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Meijuan Zheng, Zhigang Tian<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31787967">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Association Between Simian Virus 40 and Human Tumors.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a small DNA tumor virus of monkey origin. This polyomavirus was administered to human populations mainly through contaminated polio vaccines, which were produced in naturally infected SV40 monkey cells. Previous molecular biology and recent immunological assays have indicated that SV40 is spreading in human populations, independently from earlier SV40-contaminated vaccines. SV40 DNA sequences have been detected at a higher prevalence in specific human cancer specimens, such as the brain and bone tumors, malignant pleural mesotheliomas, and lymphoproliferative disorders, compared to the corresponding normal tissues/specimens. However, other investigations, which reported negative data, did not confirm an association between SV40 and human tumors. To circumvent the controversies, which have arisen because of these molecular biology studies, immunological researches with newly developed indirect ELISA tests were carried out in serum samples from patients affected by the same kind of tumors as mentioned above. These innovative indirect ELISAs employ synthetic peptides as mimotopes/specific SV40 antigens. SV40 mimotopes do not cross-react with the homologous human polyomaviruses, BKPyV, and JCPyV. Immunological data obtained from indirect ELISAs, using SV40 mimotopes, employed to analyze serum samples from oncological patients, have indicated that these sera had a higher prevalence of antibodies against SV40 compared to healthy subjects. The main data on (i) the biology and genetics of SV40; (ii) the epidemiology of SV40 in the general population, (iii) the mechanisms of SV40 transformation; (iv) the putative role of SV40 in the onset/progression of specific human tumors, and (v) its association with other human diseases are reported in this review.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-13<br><b>Authors:</b> John Charles Rotondo, Elisa Mazzoni, Ilaria Bononi, Mauro Tognon, Fernanda Martini<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Oncol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2234-943X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.25<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.918<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31403031">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Soy Lecithin-Derived Liposomal Delivery Systems: Surface Modification and Current Applications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The development of natural phospholipids for nanostructured drug delivery systems has attracted much attention in the past decades. Lecithin that was derived from naturally occurring in soybeans (SL) has introduced some auspicious accomplishments to the drug carrying aspect, like effectual encapsulation, controlled release, and successful delivery of the curative factors to intracellular regions in which they procure these properties from their flexible physicochemical and biophysical properties, such as large aqueous center and biocompatible lipid, self-assembly, tunable properties, and high loading capacity. Despite the almost perfect properties as a drug carrier, liposome is known to be quite quickly eliminated from the body systems. The surface modification of liposomes has been investigated in many studies to overcome this drawback.

Despite the rapid progress in human healthcare, there are few viricidal and antiviral therapies that are efficient enough. The rapid emergence of resistance, and high costs, as well as the related side effects of synthetic antiviral drugs, raise the need to identify novel, effective, and safe alternatives against viral diseases. Nature has been of the most exceptional help and source of inspiration for developing novel multi-target antiviral compounds, affecting several steps of the viral life cycle and host proteins. For that matter and due to safety and efficacy limitations, as well as high resistance rate of conventional therapies, hundreds of natural molecules are preferred over the synthetic drugs. Besides, natural antiviral agents have shown acceptable antiviral value in both preclinical and clinical trials.This is the first review regarding molecular and cellular pathways of the virus life cycle, treatment strategies, and therapeutic targets of several viral diseases with a particular focus on anthocyanins as promising natural compounds for significant antiviral enhancements. Clinical applications and the need to develop nano-formulation of anthocyanins in drug delivery systems are also considered.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Pardis Mohammadi Pour, Sajad Fakhri, Sedigheh Asgary, Mohammad Hosein Farzaei, Javier Echeverría<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Pharmacol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1663-9812<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.86<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.256<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31787892">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Bioinspired and Biomimetic Nanotherapies for the Treatment of Infectious Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> There are still great challenges for the effective treatment of infectious diseases, although considerable achievement has been made by using antiviral and antimicrobial agents varying from small-molecule drugs, peptides/proteins, to nucleic acids. The nanomedicine approach is emerging as a new strategy capable of overcoming disadvantages of molecular therapeutics and amplifying their anti-infective activities, by localized delivery to infection sites, reducing off-target effects, and/or attenuating resistance development. Nanotechnology, in combination with bioinspired and biomimetic approaches, affords additional functions to nanoparticles derived from synthetic materials. Herein, we aim to provide a state-of-the-art review on recent progress in biomimetic and bioengineered nanotherapies for the treatment of infectious disease. Different biomimetic nanoparticles, derived from viruses, bacteria, and mammalian cells, are first described, with respect to their construction and biophysicochemical properties. Then, the applications of diverse biomimetic nanoparticles in anti-infective therapy are introduced, either by their intrinsic activity or by loading and site-specifically delivering various molecular drugs. Bioinspired and biomimetic nanovaccines for prevention and/or therapy of infectious diseases are also highlighted.

Apart from the burden on local populations, chikungunya virus infection also poses a risk for travelers and, in particular, soldiers during prolonged deployment-associated outdoor activities. The absence of rapid diagnostic tests makes surveillance challenging during military deployments in war and crisis zones with restricted medical infrastructure. Consequently, both historical and up-to-date surveillance data from battlefields are scarce. From several studies and postdeployment assessments, some information on the epidemiology of chikungunya virus infections in deployed military personnel is nevertheless available. The few published data homogeneously suggest a low infection risk in the endemic setting. During outbreaks, however, the infection risk of military personnel is comparable to that of the local population. Infection clusters of soldiers without pronounced outdoor activity have been reported under such circumstances as well. In spite of efforts focusing on the development of a chikungunya virus vaccine, no licensed product is available so far.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Hagen Frickmann, Ottmar Herchenröder<br><b>Journal:</b> Viruses<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1999-4915<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.76<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.812<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197085">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Exosomes Carry microRNAs into Neighboring Cells to Promote Diffusive Infection of Newcastle Disease Virus.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus, was shown to prefer to replicate in tumor cells instead of normal cells; however, this mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Exosomes play a crucial role in intercellular communication due to the bioactive substances they carry. Several studies have shown that exosomes are involved in virus infections. However, the effect that exosomes have on NDV-infected tumor cells is not known. In this study, we focus on the role of exosomes secreted by NDV-infected HeLa cells in promoting NDV replication. Three miRNA candidates (miR-1273f, miR-1184, and miR-198) embraced by exosomes were associated with enhancing NDV-induced cytopathic effects on HeLa cells. Furthermore, luciferase assays, RT-qPCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) all demonstrated that these miRNAs could suppress interferon (IFN)-β gene expression. Enhanced NDV replication in HeLa cells was identified by Western blot and plaque assays. Based on these results, we speculate that NDV employed exosomes entry into neighboring cells, which carry miRNAs, resulting in inhibition of the IFN pathway and promotion of viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the involvement of NDV-employed exosomes in tumor cells, and as such, it provides new insights into the development of anti-tumor therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Changluan Zhou, Lei Tan, Yingjie Sun, Xusheng Qiu, Ying Liao, Cuiping Song, Weiwei Liu, Venugopal Nair, Chan Ding<br><b>Journal:</b> Viruses<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1999-4915<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.76<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.812<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174402">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Biallelic ERBB3 loss-of-function variants are associated with a novel multisystem syndrome without congenital contracture.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Gain-of-function pathogenic variants of the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) gene contribute to the occurrence and development of a variety of human carcinomas through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. ERBB3 gene homozygous germline variants, whose loss of function may cause autosomal recessive congenital contractural syndrome, were recently identified. This study aims to identify the disease-causing gene in a Chinese pedigree with variable phenotypes involving multiple systems, including developmental delay, postnatal growth retardation, transient lower limb asymmetry, facial malformations, atrioventricular canal malformation, bilateral nystagmus and amblyopia, feeding difficulties, immunodeficiency, anemia, and liver damage, but without congenital contracture.
METHODS: Trio-whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the disease-causing gene in a 24-month-old Chinese female patient. The pathogenicity of the identified variants was evaluated using in silico tools and in vitro functional studies.
RESULTS: Trio-WES revealed compound heterozygous variants of c.1253 T > C (p.I418T) and c.3182dupA (p.N1061Kfs*16) in the ERBB3 gene. Functional studies showed that p.I418T resulted in normal expression of ERBB3, which was capable of interacting with ERBB2. However, the variant impaired ERBB3 phosphorylation, consequently blocking ERBB2 phosphorylation and AKT and ERK activation. The truncated protein resulting from the c.3182dupA variant also lacked the capacity to activate downstream signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the first patient with a novel multisystem syndrome disorder without congenital contracture resulting from biallelic loss-of-function variants of ERBB3.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Niu Li, Yufei Xu, Yi Zhang, Guoqiang Li, Tingting Yu, Ruen Yao, YunFang Zhou, Yiping Shen, Lei Yin, Xiumin Wang, Jian Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> Orphanet J Rare Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1750-1172<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.589<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752936">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Novel approaches for the design, delivery and administration of vaccine technologies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> It is easy to argue that vaccine development represents humankind's most important and successful endeavour, such is the impact that vaccination has had on human morbidity and mortality over the last 200 years. During this time the original method of Jenner and Pasteur, i.e. that of injecting live-attenuated or inactivated pathogens, has been developed and supplemented with a wide range of alternative approaches which are now in clinical use or under development. These next-generation technologies have been designed to produce a vaccine that has the effectiveness of the original live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines, but without the associated risks and limitations. Indeed, the method of development has undoubtedly moved away from Pasteur's three Is paradigm (isolate, inactivate, inject) towards an approach of rational design, made possible by improved knowledge of the pathogen-host interaction and the mechanisms of the immune system. These novel vaccines have explored methods for targeted delivery of antigenic material, as well as for the control of release profiles, so that dosing regimens can be matched to the time-lines of immune system stimulation and the realities of health-care delivery in dispersed populations. The methods by which vaccines are administered are also the subject of intense research in the hope that needle and syringe dosing, with all its associated issues regarding risk of injury, cross-infection and patient compliance, can be replaced. This review provides a detailed overview of new vaccine vectors as well as information pertaining to the novel delivery platforms under development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-09<br><b>Authors:</b> J Wallis, D P Shenton, R C Carlisle<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin.

Although the emphasis is on the biomaterial as a scaffold it is also the use of additive bioactivity to enhance the healing and regenerative properties of the scaffold. Enhancing regeneration is both moving more toward regeneration but also speeding up the process. The review covers principles of design for BER as well as strategies to select the best designs. This is first general design principles, followed by types of design options, and then specific strategies for applications in skin and load bearing applications. The last section, surveys current clinical practice (for skin and load bearing applications) including limitations of these approaches. This is followed by future directions with an attempt to prioritize strategies. Although the review is geared toward design optimization, prioritization also includes the commercializability of the devices. This means a device must meet both the clinical performance design constraints as well as the commercializability design constraints.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-01-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Dale S Feldman<br><b>Journal:</b> J Funct Biomater<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2079-4983<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.27<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.755<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691135">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Magnetic Particles for Advanced Molecular Diagnosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Molecular diagnosis is the field that aims to develop nucleic-acid-based analytical methods for biological markers and gene expression assessments by combining laboratory medicine and molecular genetics.

The efficacy of a DNA vaccine depends on optimal antigen expression by the injected plasmid DNA. The pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) is a novel system that allows for adjustment of injection depth and may, thus, provide a targeted delivery approach for various therapeutic or preventative compounds. Herein, we investigated its potential for use in delivering DNA vaccines. This study evaluated the optimal ignition powder dosage, as well as its delivery effectiveness in both rat and mouse models, while comparing the results of the PJI with that of a needle syringe delivery system. We found that the PJI effectively delivered plasmid DNA to intradermal regions in both rats and mice. Further, it efficiently transfected plasmid DNA directly into the nuclei, resulting in higher protein expression than that achieved via needle syringe injection. Moreover, results from animal ovalbumin (OVA) antigen induction models revealed that animals receiving OVA expression plasmids (pOVA) via PJI exhibited dose-dependent (10 μg, 60 μg, and 120 μg) production of anti-OVA antibodies; while only low titers (< 1/100) of OVA antibodies were detected when 120 μg of pOVA was injected via needle syringe. Thus, PJI is an effective, novel method for delivery of plasmid DNA into epidermal and dermal cells suggesting its promise as a tool for DNA vaccination.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Chinyang Chang, Jiao Sun, Hiroki Hayashi, Ayano Suzuki, Yuko Sakaguchi, Hiroshi Miyazaki, Tomoyuki Nishikawa, Hironori Nakagami, Kunihiko Yamashita, Yasufumi Kaneda<br><b>Journal:</b> AAPS PharmSciTech<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1530-9932<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.42<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.633<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31820256">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Decoding inflammation, its causes, genomic responses, and emerging countermeasures.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Inflammation is the mechanism of diseases caused by microbial, autoimmune, allergic, metabolic and physical insults that produce distinct types of inflammatory responses. This aetiologic view of inflammation informs its classification based on a cause-dependent mechanism as well as a cause-directed therapy and prevention. The genomic era ushered in a new understanding of inflammation by highlighting the cell's nucleus as the centre of the inflammatory response. Exogenous or endogenous inflammatory insults evoke genomic responses in immune and non-immune cells. These genomic responses depend on transcription factors, which switch on and off a myriad of inflammatory genes through their regulatory networks. We discuss the transcriptional paradigm of inflammation based on denying transcription factors' access to the nucleus. We present two approaches that control proinflammatory signalling to the nucleus. The first approach constitutes a novel intracellular protein therapy with bioengineered physiologic suppressors of cytokine signalling. The second approach entails control of proinflammatory transcriptional cascades by targeting nuclear transport with a cell-penetrating peptide that inhibits the expression of 23 out of the 26 mediators of inflammation along with the nine genes required for metabolic responses. We compare these emerging anti-inflammatory countermeasures to current therapies.

Deregulated expression of TOXs has been reported in a variety of cancer types, including lung cancer. It has also been reported that TOXs are crucial regulators of the immune system. The present study systematically evaluated the prognostic values of TOX family members using a set of publicly accessible databases, including Oncomine, Kaplan-Meier plotter and cBioPortal. It was revealed that TOX expression profiles differed between lung cancer and normal tissues, and high expression of TOX mRNAs generally predicted improved survival outcomes. Notably, TOX3 expression was significantly increased in lung adenocarcinoma, compared with other pathological subtypes of lung cancer. Survival analysis demonstrated that elevated TOX3 expression was significantly associated with improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that TOX3 expression was negatively correlated with the expression of programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1), PD-ligand 1 and Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 in lung adenocarcinoma. These results indicated that TOX3 is a prognostic indicator and promising immunomodulatory factor in lung adenocarcinoma. Future studies investigating the role of TOX3 in lung cancer immunity are warranted.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-13<br><b>Authors:</b> De Zeng, Haoyu Lin, Jianxiong Cui, Weiquan Liang<br><b>Journal:</b> Oncol Lett<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1792-1074<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.593<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516613">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Liquid biopsy for lung cancer immunotherapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The recent successful use of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand 1 in clinical trials indicates their crucial role in obtaining an effective cancer immune therapy. These CPIs have been identified to have an effective therapeutic response, particularly in tumors with high tumor mutation burden. Targeting private somatic mutations encoding immunogenic neoantigens (neo-Ags) has been developed as an autologous gene therapy. T-cell receptor-engineered T cells targeting neo-Ags are a novel option for adoptive cell therapy used for the treatment of lung cancer. However, not all patients experience an effective response from immunotherapy. Although the resistance mechanism of CPIs has been reported, its association with other treatment methods during systemic anticancer therapy remains unclear, particularly the treatment options following the emergence of drug resistance in lung cancer. The potential biomarkers used for liquid biopsy may assist in the identification of patients who would benefit the most from immunotherapy. Attempts to identify potential biomarkers for predicting clinical response to immunotherapy are underway. With regard to liquid biopsy, the present review summarizes and discusses the lung cancer management of immunotherapy for precision medicine by reviewing recent literature and associated clinical trials.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Liang-Liang Cai, Jie Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> Oncol Lett<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1792-1074<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.593<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186680">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> 'Don't put your head under water': enteric viruses in Brazilian recreational waters.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Like in many other countries, virologic analyses are not routinely performed in Brazil in monitoring water quality for recreational purposes.

Among the enteric viruses studied in Brazilian recreational waters, we highlight adenoviruses, rotaviruses, enteroviruses and noroviruses. Although there has been relatively little research on outbreaks related to bathing in recreational water environments in Brazil, noroviruses and adenoviruses are the viruses that are most often related to outbreaks. Better surveillance of the occurrence of enteric viruses in water could improve the assessment of risk to human health as well as indicate the sources of contamination and thus demonstrate the importance of adequate environmental sanitation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-22<br><b>Authors:</b> V Girardi, M Demoliner, J S Gularte, F R Spilki<br><b>Journal:</b> New Microbes New Infect<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2052-2975<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.60<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.780<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899523">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dendritic Cells/Macrophages-Targeting Feature of Ebola Glycoprotein and its Potential as Immunological Facilitator for Antiviral Vaccine Approach.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In the prevention of epidemic and pandemic viral infection, the use of the antiviral vaccine has been the most successful biotechnological and biomedical approach. In recent times, vaccine development studies have focused on recruiting and targeting immunogens to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages to induce innate and adaptive immune responses. Interestingly, Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) has a strong binding affinity with DCs and macrophages. Shreds of evidence have also shown that the interaction between EBOV GP with DCs and macrophages leads to massive recruitment of DCs and macrophages capable of regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Therefore, studies for the development of vaccine can utilize the affinity between EBOV GP and DCs/macrophages as a novel immunological approach to induce both innate and acquired immune responses. In this review, we will discuss the unique features of EBOV GP to target the DC, and its potential to elicit strong immune responses while targeting DCs/macrophages. This review hopes to suggest and stimulate thoughts of developing a stronger and effective DC-targeting vaccine for diverse virus infection using EBOV GP.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Titus Abiola Olukitibi, Zhujun Ao, Mona Mahmoudi, Gary A Kobinger, Xiaojian Yao<br><b>Journal:</b> Microorganisms<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2076-2607<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569539">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nanoparticles in the clinic: An update.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Nanoparticle drug delivery systems have been used in the clinic since the early 1990's.

Thirty healthy adults of the same ethnicity were enrolled in the control group. Whole venous blood was obtained from the patients and normal controls (n = 30). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed, and we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative real-time PCR to measure the serum levels and relative mRNA expression of IL-17, respectively. IL-17 promoter methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by methylation-specific PCR. We analyzed the serum and mRNA levels of IL-17 and IL-17 promoter methylation in the 4 groups as well as the effect of methylation on serum IL-17 levels. Correlations between the IL-17 promoter methylation status and clinical parameters were analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis.Compared to the normal control group, the patient groups exhibited significantly higher serum and relative mRNA levels of IL-17. The methylation distribution among the patients was significantly lower than that among the normal controls (P < .05), with the HBV-HCC group showing the lowest IL-17 gene methylation frequency. The average IL-17 promoter CG methylation level was negatively correlated with IL-17 mRNA expression (r = -0.39, P = .03), and negative correlations between IL-17 promoter methylation and prothrombin time activity (r = -0.585, P = .035), alanine aminotransferase (r = -0.522, P < .01), aspartate aminotransferase (r = -0.315, P < .05), and the model for end-stage liver disease score (r = -0.461, P < .05) were observed. IL-17 serum levels in the methylated-promoter groups were significantly lower than those in the unmethylated-promoter groups.IL-17 expression and promoter methylation were associated with chronic HBV infection progression, especially in the HBV-HCC group.

It can present insidiously with liver disease in children. Although clinical practice guidelines exist for the management of AAT deficiency, especially with regards to pulmonary involvement, there are no published recommendations that specifically relate to the management of the liver disease and monitoring for lung disease associated with this condition, particularly in children.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the management of AAT deficiency-associated liver disease in adults and children.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic search for articles indexed in PubMed and published was undertaken. Some earlier selected landmark references were included in the review. Search terms included: "alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency"; "liver disease"; "end-stage liver disease"; "liver transplantation" and "preventative management". Recommendations for the management of children with suspected or confirmed AAT deficiency were made according to the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy scale.
FINDINGS: Liver complications arising from AAT deficiency result from the accumulation of mutated AAT protein within hepatocytes. Liver disease occurs in 10% of children, manifested by cholestasis, pruritus, poor feeding, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, but the presentation is highly variable. A diagnostic test for AAT deficiency is recommended for these children. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained to assess for liver involvement; however, the only curative treatment for AAT deficiency-associated liver disease is organ transplantation. Conclusion and Relevance: There should be a greater vigilance for AAT deficiency testing among pediatricians. Diagnosis should prompt assessment of liver involvement. Children with AATdeficiency- associated liver disease should be referred to a liver specialist and monitored throughout their lifetimes for the symptoms of AAT-deficiency-related pulmonary involvement.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2018-11-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Henry C Lin, Nagraj Kasi, J Antonio Quiros<br><b>Journal:</b> Curr Pediatr Rev<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1875-6336<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30421678">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Hydrophobic modified peptides and their use for liver specific targeting<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present invention relates to hydrophobic modified peptides for the specific delivery of compounds to the liver, preferably to hepatocytes, in vitro as well as in vivo.
