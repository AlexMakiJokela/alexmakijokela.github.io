However, the key pathological processes underlying cyst development and exacerbation in pre-symptomatic stages remain unknown, because rodent models do not recapitulate critical disease phenotypes, including disease onset in heterozygotes. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generate ADPKD models with PKD1 mutations in cynomolgus monkeys. As in humans and mice, near-complete PKD1 depletion induces severe cyst formation mainly in collecting ducts. Importantly, unlike in mice, PKD1 heterozygote monkeys exhibit cyst formation perinatally in distal tubules, possibly reflecting the initial pathology in humans. Many monkeys in these models survive after cyst formation, and cysts progress with age. Furthermore, we succeed in generating selective heterozygous mutations using allele-specific targeting. We propose that our models elucidate the onset and progression of ADPKD, which will serve as a critical basis for establishing new therapeutic strategies, including drug treatments.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Tomoyuki Tsukiyama, Kenichi Kobayashi, Masataka Nakaya, Chizuru Iwatani, Yasunari Seita, Hideaki Tsuchiya, Jun Matsushita, Kahoru Kitajima, Ikuo Kawamoto, Takahiro Nakagawa, Koji Fukuda, Teppei Iwakiri, Hiroyuki Izumi, Iori Itagaki, Shinji Kume, Hiroshi Maegawa, Ryuichi Nishinakamura, Saori Nishio, Shinichiro Nakamura, Akihiro Kawauchi, Masatsugu Ema<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822676">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Autophagy is inhibited by ubiquitin ligase activity in the nervous system.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic process prominent in starvation, aging and disease. Neuronal autophagy is particularly important, as it affects the development and function of the nervous system, and is heavily implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Nonetheless, how autophagy is regulated in neurons remains poorly understood. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we demonstrate that the primary initiator of autophagy, the UNC-51/ULK kinase, is negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1. RPM-1 ubiquitin ligase activity restricts UNC-51 and autophagosome formation within specific axonal compartments, and exerts effects broadly across the nervous system. By restraining UNC-51 activity, RPM-1 inhibits autophagosome formation to affect axon termination, synapse maintenance and behavioral habituation. These results demonstrate how UNC-51 and autophagy are regulated subcellularly in axons, and unveils a mechanism for restricting initiation of autophagy across the nervous system. Our findings have important implications beyond nervous system development, given growing links between altered autophagy regulation and neurodegenerative diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Crawley, Karla J Opperman, Muriel Desbois, Isabel Adrados, Melissa A Borgen, Andrew C Giles, Derek R Duckett, Brock Grill<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676756">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Biological membranes in EV biogenesis, stability, uptake, and cargo transfer: an ISEV position paper arising from the ISEV membranes and EVs workshop.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Paracrine and endocrine roles have increasingly been ascribed to extracellular vesicles (EVs) generated by multicellular organisms. Central to the biogenesis, content, and function of EVs are their delimiting lipid bilayer membranes. To evaluate research progress on membranes and EVs, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) conducted a workshop in March 2018 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, bringing together key opinion leaders and hands-on researchers who were selected on the basis of submitted applications. The workshop was accompanied by two scientific surveys and covered four broad topics: EV biogenesis and release; EV uptake and fusion; technologies and strategies used to study EV membranes; and EV transfer and functional assays. In this ISEV position paper, we synthesize the results of the workshop and the related surveys to outline important outstanding questions about EV membranes and describe areas of consensus. The workshop discussions and survey responses reveal that while much progress has been made in the field, there are still several concepts that divide opinion. Good consensus exists in some areas, including particular aspects of EV biogenesis, uptake and downstream signalling. Areas with little to no consensus include EV storage and stability, as well as whether and how EVs fuse with target cells. Further research is needed in these key areas, as a better understanding of membrane biology will contribute substantially towards advancing the field of extracellular vesicles.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Ashley E Russell, Alexandra Sneider, Kenneth W Witwer, Paolo Bergese, Suvendra N Bhattacharyya, Alexander Cocks, Emanuele Cocucci, Uta Erdbrügger, Juan M Falcon-Perez, David W Freeman, Thomas M Gallagher, Shuaishuai Hu, Yiyao Huang, Steven M Jay, Shin-Ichi Kano, Gregory Lavieu, Aleksandra Leszczynska, Alicia M Llorente, Quan Lu, Vasiliki Mahairaki, Dillon C Muth, Nicole Noren Hooten, Matias Ostrowski, Ilaria Prada, Susmita Sahoo, Tine Hiorth Schøyen, Lifu Sheng, Deanna Tesch, Guillaume Van Niel, Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke, Frederik J Verweij, Ana V Villar, Marca Wauben, Ann M Wehman, Hang Yin, David Raul Francisco Carter, Pieter Vader<br><b>Journal:</b> J Extracell Vesicles<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2001-3078<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 10.65<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.283<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31762963">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A systematic capsid evolution approach performed in vivo for the design of AAV vectors with tailored properties and tropism.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid modification enables the generation of recombinant vectors with tailored properties and tropism. Most approaches to date depend on random screening, enrichment, and serendipity. The approach explored here, called BRAVE (barcoded rational AAV vector evolution), enables efficient selection of engineered capsid structures on a large scale using only a single screening round in vivo. The approach stands in contrast to previous methods that require multiple generations of enrichment. With the BRAVE approach, each virus particle displays a peptide, derived from a protein, of known function on the AAV capsid surface, and a unique molecular barcode in the packaged genome. The sequencing of RNA-expressed barcodes from a single-generation in vivo screen allows the mapping of putative binding sequences from hundreds of proteins simultaneously. Using the BRAVE approach and hidden Markov model-based clustering, we present 25 synthetic capsid variants with refined properties, such as retrograde axonal transport in specific subtypes of neurons, as shown for both rodent and human dopaminergic neurons.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Marcus Davidsson, Gang Wang, Patrick Aldrin-Kirk, Tiago Cardoso, Sara Nolbrant, Morgan Hartnor, Janitha Mudannayake, Malin Parmar, Tomas Björklund<br><b>Journal:</b> Proc.

As such, there has been some progress toward therapies that modulate the microbiota with the aim of limiting immune-mediated demyelination, as occurs in multiple sclerosis. However, remyelination-the regeneration of myelin sheaths-also depends upon an immune response, and the effects that such interventions might have on remyelination have not yet been explored. Here, we show that the inflammatory response during CNS remyelination in mice is modulated by antibiotic or probiotic treatment, as well as in germ-free mice. We also explore the effect of these changes on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation, which is inhibited by antibiotics but unaffected by our other interventions. These results reveal that high combined doses of oral antibiotics impair oligodendrocyte progenitor cell responses during remyelination and further our understanding of how mammalian regeneration relates to the microbiota.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Christopher E McMurran, Alerie Guzman de la Fuente, Rosana Penalva, Ofra Ben Menachem-Zidon, Yvonne Dombrowski, John Falconer, Ginez A Gonzalez, Chao Zhao, Fynn N Krause, Adam M H Young, Julian L Griffin, Clare A Jones, Claire Hollins, Markus M Heimesaat, Denise C Fitzgerald, Robin J M Franklin<br><b>Journal:</b> Proc.

Such knowledge of human neural circuits is difficult, at best, to obtain. Here, we study firing properties of human subthalamic neurons, using microelectrode recordings and microstimulation during awake surgery for Parkinson's disease. We demonstrate that low-amplitude, brief trains of microstimulation can lead to persistent changes in neuronal firing behavior including switching between firing rates, entering silent periods, or firing several bursts then entering a silent period. We suggest that these multistable states reflect properties of finite state machines and could have implications for the function of circuits involving the subthalamic nucleus. Furthermore, understanding these states could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed at regulating the transitions between states.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy W Chopek, Hans Hultborn, Robert M Brownstone<br><b>Journal:</b> Proc.

A significant issue faced by CAR-T therapies is the lack of tumor-specific biomarkers on the surfaces of solid tumor cells, which hampers the application of CAR-T therapies to solid tumors. Intracellular tumor-related antigens can be presented as peptides in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the cell surface, which interact with the T cell receptors (TCR) on antigen-specific T cells to stimulate an anti-tumor response. Multiple immunotherapy strategies have been developed to eradicate tumor cells through targeting the TCR-peptide/MHC interactions. Here, we summarize the current status of TCR-based immunotherapy strategies, with particular focus on the TCR structure, activated signaling pathways, the effects and toxicity associated with TCR-based therapies in clinical trials, preclinical studies examining immune-mobilizing monoclonal TCRs against cancer (ImmTACs), and TCR-fusion molecules. We propose several TCR-based therapeutic strategies to achieve optimal clinical responses without the induction of autoimmune diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Qinghua He, Xianhan Jiang, Xinke Zhou, Jinsheng Weng<br><b>Journal:</b> J Hematol Oncol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-8722<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 8.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.960<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852498">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> 34th Annual Meeting & Pre-Conference Programs of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC 2019): part 1 : National Harbor, MD, USA. 6-10 November 2019.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> <br><b>Journal:</b> J Immunother Cancer<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2051-1426<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 8.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.337<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694725">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Organotypic brain slice cultures to model neurodegenerative proteinopathies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Organotypic slice cultures of brain or spinal cord have been a longstanding tool in neuroscience research but their utility for understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies has only recently begun to be evaluated. Organotypic brain slice cultures (BSCs) represent a physiologically relevant three-dimensional model of the brain. BSCs support all the central nervous system (CNS) cell types and can be produced from brain areas involved in neurodegenerative disease. BSCs can be used to better understand the induction and significance of proteinopathies underlying the development and progression of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, and in the future may serve as bridging technologies between cell culture and in vivo experiments for the development and evaluation of novel therapeutic targets and strategies. We review the initial development and general use of BSCs in neuroscience research and highlight the advantages of these cultures as an ex vivo model. Subsequently we focus on i) BSC-based modeling of AD and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies ii) use of BSCs to understand mechanisms underlying these diseases and iii) how BSCs can serve as tools to screen for suitable therapeutics prior to in vivo investigations.

The technology has even been applied to the functional interrogation of the non-coding genome. However, applications of this technology to neurological diseases remain scarce.

Inability to maintain lysosomal acidic pH is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms elicited by impaired lysosomal acidification remain poorly understood. We show here that inhibition of lysosomal acidification triggers cellular iron deficiency, which results in impaired mitochondrial function and non-apoptotic cell death. These effects are recovered by supplying iron via a lysosome-independent pathway. Notably, iron deficiency is sufficient to trigger inflammatory signaling in cultured primary neurons. Using a mouse model of impaired lysosomal acidification, we observed a robust iron deficiency response in the brain, verified by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, the brains of these mice present a pervasive inflammatory signature associated with instability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), both corrected by supplementation of the mice diet with iron.

The Rab5 GEF, Rabex5, was previously proposed to be auto-inhibited by its C-terminus. Here, we studied full-length Rabex5 and Rabaptin5 proteins as well as domain deletion Rabex5 mutants using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. We generated a structural model of Rabex5, using chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry and integrative modeling techniques. By correlating structural changes with nucleotide exchange activity for each construct, we uncovered new auto-regulatory roles for the ubiquitin binding domains and the Linker connecting those domains to the catalytic core of Rabex5. We further provide evidence that enhanced dynamics in the catalytic core are linked to catalysis. Our results suggest a more complex auto-regulation mechanism than previously thought and imply that ubiquitin binding serves not only to position Rabex5 but to also control its Rab5 GEF activity through allosteric structural alterations.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Janelle Lauer, Sandra Segeletz, Alice Cezanne, Giambattista Guaitoli, Francesco Raimondi, Marc Gentzel, Vikram Alva, Michael Habeck, Yannis Kalaidzidis, Marius Ueffing, Andrei N Lupas, Christian Johannes Gloeckner, Marino Zerial<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31718772">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Computational and cellular studies reveal structural destabilization and degradation of MLH1 variants in Lynch syndrome.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Defective mismatch repair leads to increased mutation rates, and germline loss-of-function variants in the repair component MLH1 cause the hereditary cancer predisposition disorder known as Lynch syndrome.

To identify novel autophagy regulators, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in H4 human neuroglioma cells expressing endogenous LC3B tagged with a tandem of GFP and mCherry. Using this methodology, we identified the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA6 and the hybrid ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/ubiquitin ligase BIRC6 as autophagy regulators. We found that these enzymes cooperate to monoubiquitinate LC3B, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Knockout of UBA6 or BIRC6 increased autophagic flux under conditions of nutrient deprivation or protein synthesis inhibition. Moreover, UBA6 or BIRC6 depletion decreased the formation of aggresome-like induced structures in H4 cells, and α-synuclein aggregates in rat hippocampal neurons. These findings demonstrate that UBA6 and BIRC6 negatively regulate autophagy by limiting the availability of LC3B.

LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases within their Switch-II motif controlling interaction with effectors. An siRNA screen of all human protein phosphatases revealed that a poorly studied protein phosphatase, PPM1H, counteracts LRRK2 signaling by specifically dephosphorylating Rab proteins. PPM1H knockout increased endogenous Rab phosphorylation and inhibited Rab dephosphorylation in human A549 cells. Overexpression of PPM1H suppressed LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation. PPM1H also efficiently and directly dephosphorylated Rab8A in biochemical studies. A "substrate-trapping" PPM1H mutant (Asp288Ala) binds with high affinity to endogenous, LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab proteins, thereby blocking dephosphorylation seen upon addition of LRRK2 inhibitors. PPM1H is localized to the Golgi and its knockdown suppresses primary cilia formation, similar to pathogenic LRRK2. Thus, PPM1H acts as a key modulator of LRRK2 signaling by controlling dephosphorylation of Rab proteins.

It was shown that human astrocytes with mutations in genes associated with ALS, like C9orf72 (C9) or SOD1, reduce survival of MNs. Astrocyte toxicity may be related to their dysfunction or the release of neurotoxic factors.
METHODS: We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes from ALS patients carrying C9orf72 mutations and non-affected donors. We utilized these cells to investigate astrocytic induced neuronal toxicity, changes in astrocyte transcription profile as well as changes in secretome profiles.
FINDINGS: We report that C9-mutated astrocytes are toxic to MNs via soluble factors. The toxic effects of astrocytes are positively correlated with the length of astrocyte propagation in culture, consistent with the age-related nature of ALS. We show that C9-mutated astrocytes downregulate the secretion of several antioxidant proteins. In line with these findings, we show increased astrocytic oxidative stress and senescence. Importantly, media conditioned by C9-astrocytes increased oxidative stress in wild type MNs.
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that dysfunction of C9-astrocytes leads to oxidative stress of themselves and MNs, which probably contributes to neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies in familial ALS must not only target MNs but also focus on astrocytes to abrogate nervous system injury.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Anastasya Birger, Israel Ben-Dor, Miri Ottolenghi, Tikva Turetsky, Yaniv Gil, Sahar Sweetat, Liat Perez, Vitali Belzer, Natania Casden, Debora Steiner, Michal Izrael, Eithan Galun, Eva Feldman, Oded Behar, Benjamin Reubinoff<br><b>Journal:</b> EBioMedicine<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2352-3964<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.49<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.847<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31787569">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Synapse alterations precede neuronal damage and storage pathology in a human cerebral organoid model of CLN3-juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The juvenile form of neuronal ceroid Lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is the most common form within this group of rare lysosomal storage disorders, causing pediatric neurodegeneration.

Progranulin haploinsufficiency may drive frontotemporal dementia pathogenesis by disrupting lysosomal function, as patients with GRN mutations on both alleles develop the lysosomal storage disorder neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and frontotemporal dementia patients with GRN mutations (FTD-GRN) also accumulate lipofuscin. The specific lysosomal deficits caused by progranulin insufficiency remain unclear, but emerging data indicate that progranulin insufficiency may impair lysosomal sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes. We investigated the effects of progranulin insufficiency on sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in the inferior frontal gyrus of FTD-GRN patients using fluorogenic activity assays, biochemical profiling of enzyme levels and posttranslational modifications, and quantitative neuropathology. Of the enzymes studied, only β-glucocerebrosidase exhibited impairment in FTD-GRN patients. Brains from FTD-GRN patients had lower activity than controls, which was associated with lower levels of mature β-glucocerebrosidase protein and accumulation of insoluble, incompletely glycosylated β-glucocerebrosidase. Immunostaining revealed loss of neuronal β-glucocerebrosidase in FTD-GRN patients. To investigate the effects of progranulin insufficiency on β-glucocerebrosidase outside of the context of neurodegeneration, we investigated β-glucocerebrosidase activity in progranulin-insufficient mice.

A single mutation in the human GRN gene resulting in reduced PGRN expression causes types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration resulting in frontotemporal dementia. Prosaposin (PSAP) is also a multifunctional neuroprotective secreted protein and regulator of lysosomal function. Interactions of PGRN and PSAP affect their functional properties. Their roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, have not been defined. In this report, we examined in detail the cellular expression of PGRN in middle temporal gyrus samples of a series of human brain cases (n = 45) staged for increasing plaque pathology. Immunohistochemistry showed PGRN expression in cortical neurons, microglia, cerebral vessels and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, while PSAP expression was mainly detected in neurons and Aβ plaques, and to a limited extent in astrocytes. We showed that there were increased levels of PGRN protein in AD cases and corresponding increased levels of PSAP. Levels of PGRN and PSAP protein positively correlated with amyloid beta (Aβ), with PGRN levels correlating with phosphorylated tau (serine 205) levels in these samples. Although PGRN colocalized with lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 in neurons, most PGRN associated with Aβ plaques did not. Aβ plaques with PGRN and PSAP deposits were identified in the low plaque non-demented cases suggesting this was an early event in plaque formation. We did not observe PGRN-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Co-immunoprecipitation studies of PGRN from brain samples identified only PSAP associated with PGRN, not sortilin or other known PGRN-binding proteins, under conditions used. Most PGRN associated with Aβ plaques were immunoreactive for PSAP showing a high degree of colocalization of these proteins that did not change between disease groups. As PGRN supplementation has been considered as a therapeutic approach for AD, the possible involvement of PGRN and PSAP interactions in AD pathology needs to be further considered.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Anarmaa Mendsaikhan, Ikuo Tooyama, Jean-Pierre Bellier, Geidy E Serrano, Lucia I Sue, Lih-Fen Lue, Thomas G Beach, Douglas G Walker<br><b>Journal:</b> Acta Neuropathol Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2051-5960<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.93<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.279<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31864418">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Kinesin light chain-1 serine-460 phosphorylation is altered in Alzheimer's disease and regulates axonal transport and processing of the amyloid precursor protein.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Damage to axonal transport is an early pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key axonal transport cargo since disruption to APP transport promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Moreover, altered APP processing itself disrupts axonal transport. The mechanisms that regulate axonal transport of APP are therefore directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP is transported anterogradely through axons on kinesin-1 motors and one route for this transport involves calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane spanning protein that acts as a direct ligand for kinesin-1 light chains (KLCs). Thus, loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts APP axonal transport and promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Phosphorylation of KLC1 on serine-460 has been shown to reduce anterograde axonal transport of calsyntenin-1 by inhibiting the KLC1-calsyntenin-1 interaction. Here we demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease frontal cortex, KLC1 levels are reduced and the relative levels of KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation are increased; these changes occur relatively early in the disease process. We also show that a KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant inhibits axonal transport of APP in both mammalian neurons in culture and in Drosophila neurons in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of the KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Together, these results suggest that increased KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation contributes to Alzheimer's disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Gábor M Mórotz, Elizabeth B Glennon, Jenny Greig, Dawn H W Lau, Nishita Bhembre, Francesca Mattedi, Nadine Muschalik, Wendy Noble, Alessio Vagnoni, Christopher C J Miller<br><b>Journal:</b> Acta Neuropathol Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2051-5960<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.93<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.279<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31806024">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The many substrates and functions of NEDD4-1.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and prognosis are highly related to gene alterations and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Ubiquitination is a critical PTM that governs practically all aspects of cellular function. An increasing number of studies show that E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) are important enzymes in the process of ubiquitination that primarily determine substrate specificity and thus need to be tightly controlled. Among E3s, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-1 (NEDD4-1) has been shown to play a critical role in modulating the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells and the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer therapies via regulating multiple substrates. This review discusses some significant discoveries on NEDD4-1 substrates and the signaling pathways in which NEDD4-1 participates. In addition, we introduce the latest potential therapeutic strategies that inhibit or activate NEDD4-1 activity using small molecules.

To date, in addition to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, gene delivery has emerged as a potential therapeutic modality for ovarian cancer. Efficient and safe targeted gene delivery is complicated due to the tumor heterogeneity barrier. Ultrasound (US)-stimulated microbubbles (MBs) have demonstrated a method of enabling non-invasive targeted gene delivery.
Purpose: The purpose of our study was to show the utility of poly(ethylene glycol)-SS-polyethylenimine-loaded microbubbles (PSP@MB) as an ultrasound theranostic and redox-responsive agent in a gene delivery system.
Patients and methods: PSP nanoparticles were conjugated to the MB surface through biotin-avidin linkage, increasing the gene-loading efficiency of MB. The significant increase in the release of genes from the PSP@MB complexes was achieved upon ultrasound exposure. The positive surface charge in PSP@MB can condense the plasmid through electrostatic interactions; agarose-gel electrophoresis further confirmed the ability of PSP@MB to condense plasmids. The morphology, particle sizes and zeta potential of PSP@MB were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering.
Results: Laser confocal microscopy showed that the combination of ultrasound with PSP@MB could promote the cellular uptake of plasmids. Plasmids which encode enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter genes or luciferase reporter genes were delivered to CSCs in vitro and to subcutaneous xenografts in vivo via the combination of ultrasound with PSP@MB. Gene transfection efficiency was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and In Vivo Imaging Systems. This study demonstrated that the combination of ultrasound with PSP@MB can remarkably promote gene delivery to solid tumors as well as diminishing the toxicity towards normal tissues in vivo. The combination of PSP@MB and the use of ultrasound can efficiently enhance accumulation, extravasation and penetration into solid tumors.
Conclusion: Taken together, our study showed that this novel PSP@MB and ultrasound-mediated gene delivery system could efficiently target CSCs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Chun Liufu, Yue Li, Jiawei Tu, Hui Zhang, Jinsui Yu, Yi Wang, Pintong Huang, Zhiyi Chen<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Nanomedicine<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-2013<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.54<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.098<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31814720">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunomodulatory Effects of Genetic Alterations Affecting the Kynurenine Pathway.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Several enzymes and metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (KP) have immunomodulatory effects. Modulation of the activities and levels of these molecules might be of particular importance under disease conditions when the amelioration of overreacting immune responses is desired. Results obtained by the use of animal and tissue culture models indicate that by eliminating or decreasing activities of key enzymes of the KP, a beneficial shift in disease outcome can be attained. This review summarizes experimental data of models in which IDO, TDO, or KMO activity modulation was achieved by interventions affecting enzyme production at a genomic level. Elimination of IDO activity was found to improve the outcome of sepsis, certain viral infections, chronic inflammation linked to diabetes, obesity, aorta aneurysm formation, and in anti-tumoral processes. Similarly, lack of TDO activity was advantageous in the case of anti-tumoral immunity, while KMO inhibition was found to be beneficial against microorganisms and in the combat against tumors, as well. On the other hand, the complex interplay among KP metabolites and immune function in some cases requires an increase in a particular enzyme activity for the desired immune response modulation, as was shown by the exacerbation of liver fibrosis due to the elimination of IDO activity and the detrimental effects of TDO inhibition in a mouse model of autoimmune gastritis. The relevance of these studies concerning possible human applications are discussed and highlighted.

LRRK2 phosphorylates multiple RAB GTPases including RAB8A and RAB10. Phosphorylated RAB10 is recruited to centrosome-localized RILPL1, which may interfere with ciliogenesis in a disease-relevant context. Our previous studies indicate that the centrosomal accumulation of phosphorylated RAB8A causes centrosomal cohesion deficits in dividing cells, including in peripheral patient-derived cells. Here, we show that both RAB8 and RAB10 contribute to the centrosomal cohesion deficits. Pathogenic LRRK2 causes the centrosomal accumulation not only of phosho-RAB8 but also of phospho-RAB10, and the effects on centrosomal cohesion are dependent on RAB8, RAB10 and RILPL1. Conversely, the pathogenic LRRK2-mediated ciliogenesis defects correlate with the centrosomal accumulation of both phospho-RAB8 and phospho-RAB10. LRRK2-mediated centrosomal cohesion and ciliogenesis alterations are observed in patient-derived peripheral cells, as well as in primary astrocytes from mutant LRRK2 mice, and are reverted upon LRRK2 kinase inhibition. These data suggest that the LRRK2-mediated centrosomal cohesion and ciliogenesis defects are distinct cellular readouts of the same underlying phospho-RAB8/RAB10/RILPL1 nexus and highlight the possibility that either centrosomal cohesion and/or ciliogenesis alterations may serve as cellular biomarkers for LRRK2-related PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Jesús Lara Ordónez, Belén Fernández, Elena Fdez, María Romo-Lozano, Jesús Madero-Pérez, Evy Lobbestael, Veerle Baekelandt, Ana Aiastui, Adolfo López de Munaín, Heather L Melrose, Laura Civiero, Sabine Hilfiker<br><b>Journal:</b> Hum.

However, it is unclear how reduced expression of this core pre-mRNA splicing factor leads to craniofacial defects. Here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase strategy to generate a human EFTUD2-knockdown cell line and show that reduced expression of EFTUD2 leads to diminished proliferative ability of these cells, increased sensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the mis-expression of several genes involved in the ER stress response. RNA-Seq analysis of the EFTUD2-knockdown cell line revealed transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression, with an enrichment for genes associated with processes involved in craniofacial development. Additionally, our RNA-Seq data identified widespread mis-splicing in EFTUD2-knockdown cells. Analysis of the functional and physical characteristics of mis-spliced pre-mRNAs highlighted conserved properties, including length and splice site strengths, of retained introns and skipped exons in our disease model. We also identified enriched processes associated with the affected genes, including cell death, cell and organ morphology and embryonic development. Together, these data support a model in which EFTUD2 haploinsufficiency leads to the mis-splicing of a distinct subset of pre-mRNAs with a widespread effect on gene expression, including altering the expression of ER stress response genes and genes involved in the development of the craniofacial region. The increased burden of unfolded proteins in the ER resulting from mis-splicing would exceed the capacity of the defective ER stress response, inducing apoptosis in cranial neural crest cells that would result in craniofacial abnormalities during development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Katherine A Wood, Charlie F Rowlands, Wasay Mohiuddin Shaikh Qureshi, Huw B Thomas, Weronika A Buczek, Tracy A Briggs, Simon J Hubbard, Kathryn E Hentges, William G Newman, Raymond T O'Keefe<br><b>Journal:</b> Hum.

Age-related dysregulation of microRNA biogenesis increases neuronal vulnerability to cellular stress and may contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. All major neurodegenerative disorders are also associated with oxidative stress, which is widely recognized as a potential target for protective therapies. Albeit often considered separately, microRNA networks and oxidative stress are inextricably entwined in neurodegenerative processes. Oxidative stress affects expression levels of multiple microRNAs and, conversely, microRNAs regulate many genes involved in an oxidative stress response. Both oxidative stress and microRNA regulatory networks also influence other processes linked to neurodegeneration, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulation of proteostasis, and increased neuroinflammation, which ultimately lead to neuronal death. Modulating the levels of a relatively small number of microRNAs may therefore alleviate pathological oxidative damage and have neuroprotective activity. Here, we review the role of individual microRNAs in oxidative stress and related pathways in four neurodegenerative conditions: Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), Huntington's (HD) disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Sphingolipidoses (SP), which usually involve the loss of sphingolipid hydrolase function, are of lysosomal origin, and represent an important group of rare diseases among lysosomal storage disorders. Initial treatments consisted of enzyme replacement therapy, but, in recent decades, various therapeutic approaches have been developed. However, these commonly used treatments for SP fail to be fully effective and do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. New approaches, such as genome editing, have great potential for both the treatment and study of sphingolipidoses. Here, we review the most recent advances in the treatment and modelling of SP through the application of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. CRISPR-Cas9 is currently the most widely used method for genome editing. This technique is versatile; it can be used for altering the regulation of genes involved in sphingolipid degradation and synthesis pathways, interrogating gene function, generating knock out models, or knocking in mutations. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is being used as an approach to disease treatment, but more frequently it is utilized to create models of disease. New CRISPR-Cas9-based tools of gene editing with diminished off-targeting effects are evolving and seem to be more promising for the correction of individual mutations.

Currently, there is hope that stroke recovery might be promoted by cell-based therapies. The field of stem cell therapy for cerebral ischemia has made significant progress in the last five years. A variety of stem cells have been tested in animal models and humans including adipose stem cells, human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, human amnion epithelial cells, human placenta amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells, adult human pluripotent-like olfactory stem cells, human bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells, electrically-stimulated human neuronal progenitor cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of human origin. Combination therapies in animal models include a mix of two or more therapeutic factors consisting of bone marrow stromal cells, exercise and thyroid hormones, endothelial progenitor cells overexpressing the chemokine CXCL12. Mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of transplanted cells include the "bystander" effects, paracrine mechanisms, or extracellular vesicles-mediated restorative effects. Mitochondria transfer also appears to be a powerful strategy for regenerative processes.

Governed by their physicochemical characteristics, the peptides can form a variety of structures with greater reactivity than conventional non-biological materials. The structural divergence of self-assembling peptides allows for various functional possibilities; when assembled, they can be used as scaffolds for cell and tissue regeneration, and vehicles for drug delivery, conferring controlled release, stability, and targeting, and avoiding side effects of drugs. These peptides can also be used as drugs themselves. In this review, we describe the basic structure and characteristics of self-assembling peptides and the various factors that affect the formation of peptide-based structures. We also summarize the applications of self-assembling peptides in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. Furthermore, the in-cell self-assembly of peptides, termed reverse self-assembly, is discussed as a novel paradigm for self-assembling peptide-based nanovehicles and nanomedicines.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Sungeun Lee, Trang H T Trinh, Miryeong Yoo, Junwu Shin, Hakmin Lee, Jaehyeon Kim, Euimin Hwang, Yong-Beom Lim, Chongsuk Ryou<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766475">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Potential Influence of the Bacterial Microbiome on the Development and Progression of ADHD.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The latest research cumulates staggering information about the correlation between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and neurodevelopmental disorders.

The concept of cell encapsulation was first proposed almost nine decades ago, however, and despite its potential, the technology has yet to deliver its promise. The few clinical trials based on cell encapsulation have not led to any licensed therapies. Progress in the field has been slow, in part due to the complexity of the technology, but also because of the difficulties encountered when trying to prevent the immune responses generated by the various microcapsule components, namely the polymer, the encapsulated cells, the therapeutic transgenes and the DNA vectors used to genetically engineer encapsulated cells. While the immune responses induced by polymers such as alginate can be minimized using highly purified materials, the need to cope with the immunogenicity of encapsulated cells is increasingly seen as key in preventing the immune rejection of microcapsules. The encapsulated cells are recognized by the host immune cells through a bidirectional exchange of immune mediators, which induce both the adaptive and innate immune responses against the engrafted capsules. The potential strategies to cope with the immunogenicity of encapsulated cells include the selective diffusion restriction of immune mediators through capsule pores and more recently inclusion in microcapsules of immune modulators such as CXCL12. Combining these strategies with the use of well-characterized cell lines harboring the immunomodulatory properties of stem cells should encourage the incorporation of cell encapsulation technology in state-of-the-art drug development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Assem Ashimova, Sergey Yegorov, Baurzhan Negmetzhanov, Gonzalo Hortelano<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Bioeng Biotechnol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2296-4185<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.248<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31850335">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nano-Enhanced Drug Delivery and Therapeutic Ultrasound for Cancer Treatment and Beyond.<br><b>Abstract:</b> While ultrasound is most widely known for its use in diagnostic imaging, the energy carried by ultrasound waves can be utilized to influence cell function and drug delivery. Consequently, our ability to use ultrasound energy at a given intensity unlocks the opportunity to use the ultrasound for therapeutic applications. Indeed, in the last decade ultrasound-based therapies have emerged with promising treatment modalities for several medical conditions. More recently, ultrasound in combination with nanomedicines, i.e., nanoparticles, has been shown to have substantial potential to enhance the efficacy of many treatments including cancer, Alzheimer disease or osteoarthritis. The concept of ultrasound combined with drug delivery is still in its infancy and more research is needed to unfold the mechanisms and interactions of ultrasound with different nanoparticles types and with various cell types. Here we present the state-of-art in ultrasound and ultrasound-assisted drug delivery with a particular focus on cancer treatments. Notably, this review discusses the application of high intensity focus ultrasound for non-invasive tumor ablation and immunomodulatory effects of ultrasound, as well as the efficacy of nanoparticle-enhanced ultrasound therapies for different medical conditions.

Even though peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) are capable of some degree of regeneration, frail recovery is seen even when the best microsurgical technique is applied. PNIs are known to be very incapacitating for the patient, due to the deprivation of motor and sensory abilities. Since there is no optimal solution for tackling this problem up to this day, the evolution in the field is constant, with innovative designs of advanced nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) being reported every day. As a basic concept, a NGC should act as a physical barrier from the external environment, concomitantly acting as physical guidance for the regenerative axons across the gap lesion. NGCs should also be able to retain the naturally released nerve growth factors secreted by the damaged nerve stumps, as well as reducing the invasion of scar tissue-forming fibroblasts to the injury site. Based on the neurobiological knowledge related to the events that succeed after a nerve injury, neuronal subsistence is subjected to the existence of an ideal environment of growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) factors. Therefore, it is known that multifunctional NGCs fabricated through combinatorial approaches are needed to improve the functional and clinical outcomes after PNIs. The present work overviews the current reports dealing with the several features that can be used to improve peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR), ranging from the simple use of hollow NGCs to tissue engineered intraluminal fillers, or to even more advanced strategies, comprising the molecular and gene therapies as well as cell-based therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Cristiana R Carvalho, Joaquim M Oliveira, Rui L Reis<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Bioeng Biotechnol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2296-4185<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.248<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31824934">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Extracellular Vesicles in Modifying the Effects of Ionizing Radiation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-coated nanovesicles actively secreted by almost all cell types. EVs can travel long distances within the body, being finally taken up by the target cells, transferring information from one cell to another, thus influencing their behavior. The cargo of EVs comprises of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins derived from the cell of origin, thereby it is cell-type specific; moreover, it differs between diseased and normal cells. Several studies have shown that EVs have a role in tumor formation and prognosis. It was also demonstrated that ionizing radiation can alter the cargo of EVs. EVs, in turn can modulate radiation responses and they play a role in radiation-induced bystander effects. Due to their biocompatibility and selective targeting, EVs are suitable nanocarrier candidates of drugs in various diseases, including cancer. Furthermore, the cargo of EVs can be engineered, and in this way they can be designed to carry certain genes or even drugs, similar to synthetic nanoparticles. In this review, we describe the biological characteristics of EVs, focusing on the recent efforts to use EVs as nanocarriers in oncology, the effects of EVs in radiation therapy, highlighting the possibilities to use EVs as nanocarriers to modulate radiation effects in clinical applications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Tünde Szatmári, Rita Hargitai, Géza Sáfrány, Katalin Lumniczky<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698689">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Development of Functional Non-Viral Vectors for Gene Delivery.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene therapy is manipulation in/of gene expression in specific cells/tissue to treat diseases. This manipulation is carried out by introducing exogenous nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, into the cell. Because of their negative charge and considerable larger size, the delivery of these molecules, in general, should be mediated by gene vectors. Non-viral vectors, as promising delivery systems, have received considerable attention due to their low cytotoxicity and non-immunogenicity. As research continued, more and more functional non-viral vectors have emerged. They not only have the ability to deliver a gene into the cells but also have other functions, such as the performance of fluorescence imaging, which aids in monitoring their progress, targeted delivery, and biodegradation. Recently, many reviews related to non-viral vectors, such as polymers and cationic lipids, have been reported. However, there are few reviews regarding functional non-viral vectors. This review summarizes the common functional non-viral vectors developed in the last ten years and their potential applications in the future. The transfection efficiency and the transport mechanism of these materials were also discussed in detail.

With the extraordinary evolution of biomedical technologies, a growing number of innovative products based on human cells and gene therapy are being tested and used as drugs. Their use on humans poses several challenges.
METHODS: In this work, we discuss some ethical issues related to gene and cell therapies translational research. We focus on early-phase studies analysing the regulatory approach of Europe and the United States. We report the current recommendations and guidelines of international scientific societies and European and American regulatory authorities.
RESULTS: The peculiarity of human cell- or tissue-based products and gene therapy has required the development of specific regulatory tools that must be continually updated in line with the progress of the research. The ethics of translational research for these products also requires further considerations, particularly with respect to the specificity of the associated risk profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: An integrated ethical approach that aims for transparency and regulation of development processes, the support of independent judgment in clinical trials and the elimination of unregulated and uncontrolled grey areas of action are necessary to move gene and cell therapy forward.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Luciana Riva, Carlo Petrini<br><b>Journal:</b> J Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1479-5876<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.20<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.591<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31779636">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Zinc transporters in Alzheimer's disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most devastating neurodegenerative disorder. Due to the increase in population and longevity, incidence will triple by the middle of the twenty-first century. So far, no treatment has prevented or reversed the disease. More than 20 years of multidisciplinary studies have shown that brain zinc dyshomeostasis may play a critical role in AD progression, which provides encouraging clues for metal-targeted therapies in the treatment of AD. Unfortunately, the pilot clinical application of zinc chelator and/or ionophore strategy, such as the use of quinoline-based compounds, namely clioquinol and PBT2, has not yet been successful. The emerging findings revealed a list of key zinc transporters whose mRNA or protein levels were abnormally altered at different stages of AD brains. Furthermore, specifically modulating the expression of some of the zinc transporters in the central nervous system through genetic methods slowed down or prevented AD progression in animal models, resulting in significantly improved cognitive performance, movement, and prolonged lifespan. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it shed new light on the treatment or prevention of the disease. This review considers recent advances regarding AD, zinc and zinc transporters, recapitulating their relationships in extending our current understanding of the disease amelioration effects of zinc transport proteins as potential therapeutic targets to cure AD, and it may also provide new insights to identify novel therapeutic strategies for ageing and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Yingshuo Xu, Guiran Xiao, Li Liu, Minglin Lang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Brain<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-6606<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.19<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.109<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818314">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Autophagic and endo-lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Due to their post-mitotic state, metabolic demands and often large polarised morphology, the function and survival of neurons is dependent on an efficient cellular waste clearance system both for generation of materials for metabolic processes and removal of toxic components. It is not surprising therefore that deficits in protein clearance can tip the balance between neuronal health and death. Here we discuss how autophagy and lysosome-mediated degradation pathways are disrupted in several neurological disorders. Both genetic and cell biological evidence show the diversity and complexity of vesicular clearance dysregulation in cells, and together may ultimately suggest a unified mechanism for neuronal demise in degenerative conditions. Causative and risk-associated mutations in Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and others have given the field a unique mechanistic insight into protein clearance processes in neurons.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and currently there is no drug treatment that can prevent or cure AD. Here, we have applied the advantages of using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons (iNs) from AD patients, which are able to offer human-specific drug responsiveness, in order to evaluate therapeutic candidates for AD. Using approach involving an inducible neurogenin-2 transgene, we have established a robust and reproducible protocol for differentiating human iPSCs into glutamatergic neurons. The AD-iN cultures that result have mature phenotypic and physiological properties, together with AD-like biochemical features that include extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation and Tau protein phosphorylation. By screening using a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach, Graptopetalum paraguayense (GP) has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent for AD from among a range of Chinese herbal medicines. We found that administration of a GP extract caused a significantly reduction in the AD-associated phenotypes of the iNs, including decreased levels of extracellular Aβ40 and Aβ42, as well as reduced Tau protein phosphorylation at positions Ser214 and Ser396. Additionally, the effect of GP was more prominent in AD-iNs compared to non-diseased controls. These findings provide valuable information that suggests moving extracts of GP toward drug development, either for treating AD or as a health supplement to prevent AD. Furthermore, our human iN-based platform promises to be a useful strategy when it is used for AD drug discovery.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Pei-Chun Wu, Ming-Ji Fann, Tu Thanh Tran, Shu-Cian Chen, Tania Devina, Irene Han-Juo Cheng, Cheng-Chang Lien, Lung-Sen Kao, Shuu-Jiun Wang, Jong-Ling Fuh, Tsai-Teng Tzeng, Chi-Ying Huang, Young-Ji Shiao, Yu-Hui Wong<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31848379">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cell-based interferon gene therapy using proliferation-controllable, interferon-releasing mesenchymal stem cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> An important safety concern on cell-based gene therapy is that few methods have been available to control the proliferation and functioning of therapeutic protein-expressing cells after transplantation.

In this study, we tried to control the amount of murine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secreted from transplanted murine mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10T1/2 cells to achieve safe cell-based IFN-γ gene therapy for cancer. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with HSVtk- and murine IFN-γ-expressing plasmid vectors to obtain C3H10T1/2/HSVtk/IFN-γ cells.

The development of biomarkers for simplifying diagnosis, monitoring disease progression and evaluating drug therapies is an important objective in research into neurodegenerative lysosomal disorders. With this in mind, we established fluorescent imaging and flow-cytometric methods to track changes in GM1 ganglioside levels in patients with GM1 gangliosidosis and in control cells.

Gaucher disease is one of the most common types of LSDs caused by mutations to the lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Here, we describe a genetic strategy to produce engineered exosomes loaded with GBA in two different spatial configurations for targeted delivery to the endocytic compartment of recipient cells. By fusing human GBA to an exosome-anchoring protein: vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), we demonstrate that the chimeric proteins were successfully integrated into exosomes which were secreted as extracellular vesicles (EVs) by producer cells. Isolation and molecular characterization of EVs confirmed that the fusion proteins were loaded onto exosomes without altering their surface markers, particle size or distribution. Further, enzyme-loaded exosomes/EVs added to cultured medium were taken up by recipient cells. Further, the endocytosed exosomes/EVs targeted to endocytic compartments exhibited a significant increase in GBA activity. Together, we have developed a novel method for targeting and delivery of lysosomal enzymes to their natural location: the endocytic compartment of recipient cells. Since exosomes/EVs have an intrinsic ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, our technology may provide a new approach to treat severe types of LSDs, including Gaucher disease with neurological complications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Mai Anh Do, Daniel Levy, Annie Brown, Gerard Marriott, Biao Lu<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31754156">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Tau interactome analyses in CRISPR-Cas9 engineered neuronal cells reveal ATPase-dependent binding of wild-type but not P301L Tau to non-muscle myosins.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Protein interactions of Tau are of interest in efforts to decipher pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease, a subset of frontotemporal dementias, and other tauopathies. We CRISPR-Cas9 edited two human cell lines to generate broadly adaptable models for neurodegeneration research. We applied the system to inducibly express balanced levels of 3-repeat and 4-repeat wild-type or P301L mutant Tau. Following 12-h induction, quantitative mass spectrometry revealed the Parkinson's disease-causing protein DJ-1 and non-muscle myosins as Tau interactors whose binding to Tau was profoundly influenced by the presence or absence of the P301L mutation. The presence of wild-type Tau stabilized non-muscle myosins at higher steady-state levels. Strikingly, in human differentiated co-cultures of neuronal and glial cells, the preferential interaction of non-muscle myosins to wild-type Tau depended on myosin ATPase activity.

The direct link of Tau to non-muscle myosins corroborates independently proposed roles of Tau in maintaining dendritic spines and mitochondrial fission biology, two subcellular niches affected early in tauopathies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhu Wang, Declan Williams, Iris Müller, Mackenzie Lemieux, Ramona Dukart, Isabella B L Maia, Hansen Wang, Amanda L Woerman, Gerold Schmitt-Ulms<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31700063">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> mTOR and autophagy pathways are dysregulated in murine and human models of Schaaf-Yang syndrome.<br><b>Abstract:</b> MAGEL2 is a maternally imprinted, paternally expressed gene, located in the Prader-Willi region of human chromosome 15. Pathogenic variants in the paternal copy of MAGEL2 cause Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SHFYNG), a neurodevelopmental disorder related to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Patients with SHFYNG, like PWS, manifest neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulties, hypogonadism, intellectual disability and sleep apnea. However, individuals with SHFYNG have joint contractures, greater cognitive impairment, and higher prevalence of autism than seen in PWS. Additionally, SHFYNG is associated with a lower prevalence of hyperphagia and obesity than PWS. Previous studies have shown that truncating variants in MAGEL2 lead to SHFYNG. However, the molecular pathways involved in manifestation of the SHFYNG disease phenotype are still unknown. Here we show that a Magel2 null mouse model and fibroblast cell lines from individuals with SHFYNG exhibit increased expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and decreased autophagy. Additionally, we show that SHFYNG induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons exhibit impaired dendrite formation. Alterations in SHFYNG patient fibroblast lines and iPSC-derived neurons are rescued by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Collectively, our findings identify mTOR as a potential target for the development of pharmacological treatments for SHFYNG.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Emeline Crutcher, Rituraj Pal, Fatemeh Naini, Ping Zhang, Magdalena Laugsch, Jean Kim, Aleksandar Bajic, Christian P Schaaf<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685878">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hydrogen sulfide treatment alleviated ventilator-induced lung injury through regulation of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Mechanical ventilation has significant therapeutic benefits, but it may cause or aggravate lung injury, which is called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has roles including regulating inflammation, and promoting vasodilatation; it also exhibits anti-oxidative stress and anti-fibrosis effects. H2S has been reported to alleviate lung injury, but the effects and mechanism of H2S on VILI remain unclear. The present study established a rat model of VILI and treated them with H2S, then measured the changes in respiratory function indicators, lung tissue histopathology, and oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic indicators. The effect of H2S on autophagy in the VILI model and the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were also investigated. To further explore the mechanism, L2 alveolar epithelial cells were treated with cyclic strain to mimic mechanical strain along with the H2S donor NaHS, and the involvement of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was examined. The results showed that H2S significantly alleviated VILI and inhibited the inflammation and oxidative stress induced by VILI. H2S also significantly reduced autophagy and ER stress in rats. The phosphorylation of IRE1α, PERK and eIF2α and the expression of nuclear ATF4, and GADD34 in L2 cells were all significantly reduced with NaHS. Nuclear NF-κB p65, MAPK p38, JNK, and ERK were all activated by cyclic strain, but inhibited by the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA or NaHS. Our findings revealed that H2S treatment alleviated VILI by regulating autophagy and ER stress, and the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/GADD34 and NF-κB/MAPK pathways were involved in the underlying mechanism.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoli Ge, Jian Sun, Aihua Fei, Chengjin Gao, Shuming Pan, Zengbin Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> Int.

Microglia in particular, may contribute to the induction and modulation of inflammation in PD. Upon stimulation, microglia convert into activated phenotypes, which exist along a dynamic continuum and bear different immune properties depending on the disease stage and severity. Activated microglia release various factors involved in neuroinflammation, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and prostaglandins (PGs). Further, activated microglia interact with other cell types (e.g., neurons, astrocytes and mast cells) and are closely associated with α-synuclein (α-syn) pathophysiology and iron homeostasis disturbance. Taken together, microglial activation and microglia-mediated inflammatory responses play essential roles in the pathogenesis of PD and elucidation of the complexity and imbalance of microglial activation may shed light on novel therapeutic approaches for PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Cai-Yun Liu, Xu Wang, Chang Liu, Hong-Liang Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Cell Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1662-5102<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.036<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803024">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Quantitative whole-brain 3D imaging of tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled neuron architecture in the mouse MPTP model of Parkinson's disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is a basal ganglia movement disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Immunohistochemical methods have been widely used for characterization of dopaminergic neuronal injury in animal models of PD, including the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model. However, conventional immunohistochemical techniques applied to tissue sections have inherent limitations with respect to loss of 3D resolution, yielding insufficient information on the architecture of the dopaminergic system. To provide a more comprehensive and non-biased map of MPTP-induced changes in central dopaminergic pathways, we used iDISCO immunolabeling, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and deep-learning computational methods for whole-brain three-dimensional visualization and automated quantitation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the adult mouse brain. Mice terminated 7 days after acute MPTP administration demonstrated widespread alterations in TH expression. Compared to vehicle controls, MPTP-dosed mice showed a significant loss of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Also, MPTP dosing reduced overall TH signal intensity in basal ganglia nuclei, i.e. the substantia nigra, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus. In contrast, increased TH signal intensity was predominantly observed in limbic regions, including several subdivisions of the amygdala and hypothalamus. In conclusion, mouse whole-brain 3D imaging is ideal for unbiased automated counting and densitometric analysis of TH-positive cells. The LSFM-deep learning pipeline tracked brain-wide changes in catecholaminergic pathways in the MPTP mouse model of PD, and may be applied for preclinical characterization of compounds targeting dopaminergic neurotransmission.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Urmas Roostalu, Casper B G Salinas, Ditte D Thorbek, Jacob L Skytte, Katrine Fabricius, Pernille Barkholt, Linu M John, Vanessa Isabell Jurtz, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, Jacob Jelsing, Niels Vrang, Henrik H Hansen, Jacob Hecksher-Sørensen<br><b>Journal:</b> Dis Model Mech<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1754-8411<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.114<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31704726">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Recent Advances in the Use of Focused Ultrasound for Magnetic Resonance Image-Guided Therapeutic Nanoparticle Delivery to the Central Nervous System.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Targeting systemically-administered drugs and genes to specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS) remains a challenge. With applications extending into numerous disorders and cancers, there is an obvious need for approaches that facilitate the delivery of therapeutics across the impervious blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging treatment method that leverages acoustic energy to oscillate simultaneously administered contrast agent microbubbles. This FUS-mediated technique temporarily disrupts the BBB, allowing ordinarily impenetrable agents to diffuse and/or convect into the CNS. Under magnetic resonance image guidance, FUS and microbubbles enable regional targeting-limiting the large, and potentially toxic, dosage that is often characteristic of systemically-administered therapies. Subsequent to delivery across the BBB, therapeutics face yet another challenge: penetrating the electrostatically-charged, mesh-like brain parenchyma. Non-bioadhesive, encapsulated nanoparticles can help overcome this additional barrier to promote widespread treatment in selected target areas. Furthermore, nanoparticles offer significant advantages over conventional systemically-administered therapeutics. Surface modifications of nanoparticles can be engineered to enhance targeted cellular uptake, and nanoparticle formulations can be tailored to control many pharmacokinetic properties such as rate of drug liberation, distribution, and excretion. For instance, nanoparticles loaded with gene plasmids foster relatively stable transfection, thus obviating the need for multiple, successive treatments. As the formulations and applications of these nanoparticles can vary greatly, this review article provides an overview of FUS coupled with polymeric or lipid-based nanoparticles currently utilized for drug delivery, diagnosis, and assessment of function in the CNS.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Delaney G Fisher, Richard J Price<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Pharmacol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1663-9812<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.86<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.256<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798453">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Chromatin accessibility and transcription dynamics during in vitro astrocyte differentiation of Huntington's Disease Monkey pluripotent stem cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Huntington's Disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion, resulting in a mutant huntingtin protein. While it is now clear that astrocytes are affected by HD and significantly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and pathogenesis, the alterations in the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles in HD astrocytes have yet to be characterized. Here, we examine global transcription and chromatin accessibility dynamics during in vitro astrocyte differentiation in a transgenic non-human primate model of HD.
RESULTS: We found global changes in accessibility and transcription across different stages of HD pluripotent stem cell differentiation, with distinct trends first observed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), once cells have committed to a neural lineage. Transcription of p53 signaling and cell cycle pathway genes was highly impacted during differentiation, with depletion in HD NPCs and upregulation in HD astrocytes. E2F target genes also displayed this inverse expression pattern, and strong associations between E2F target gene expression and accessibility at nearby putative enhancers were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that chromatin accessibility and transcription are altered throughout in vitro HD astrocyte differentiation and provide evidence that E2F dysregulation contributes to aberrant cell-cycle re-entry and apoptosis throughout the progression from NPCs to astrocytes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra V Goodnight, Isaac Kremsky, Sujittra Khampang, Yoon Hee Jung, James M Billingsley, Steven E Bosinger, Victor G Corces, Anthony W S Chan<br><b>Journal:</b> Epigenetics Chromatin<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-8935<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.84<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.064<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31722751">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Modeling Brain Somatic Mosaicism With Cerebral Organoids, Including a Note on Mutant Microglia.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The brain is a genomic mosaic.

Most of the positive modulations fostered by stem cells are fueled by bystander effects, namely increase of neurotrophic factors levels and reduction of neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of cell therapies is to promote cell replacement. Therefore, the ability of stem cells to migrate and differentiate into neurons that later become integrated into the host neuronal network replacing the lost neurons has also been largely explored. However, as most of the preclinical studies demonstrate, there is a small functional integration of graft-derived neurons into host neuronal circuits. Thus, it is mandatory to better study the whole brain cell therapy approach in order to understand what should be better comprehended concerning graft-derived neuronal and glial cells migration and integration before we can expect these therapies to be ready as a viable solution for brain disorder treatment. Therefore, this review discusses the positive mechanisms triggered by cell transplantation into the brain, the limitations of adult brain plasticity that might interfere with the neuroregeneration process, as well as some strategies tested to overcome some of these limitations. It also considers the efforts that have been made by the regulatory authorities to lead to better standardization of preclinical and clinical studies in this field in order to reduce the heterogeneity of the obtained results.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Henriques, Ricardo Moreira, Jens Schwamborn, Luís Pereira de Almeida, Liliana S Mendonça<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1662-4548<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.81<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.665<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31802998">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Microalgal Carotenoids: A Review of Production, Current Markets, Regulations, and Future Direction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Microalgae produce a variety of compounds that are beneficial to human and animal health.

The objective of this review is to evaluate the potential of using microalgae as a commercial feedstock for carotenoid production.

Significant efforts have been made to uncover the molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms that underlie NDDs. However, our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms that mediate NDDs and associated symptomatic features have been hindered by technological limitations. Our inability to identify and track individual neurons longitudinally in subcortical brain regions that are preferentially targeted in NDDs has left gaping holes in our knowledge of NDDs.

Perspectives and pitfalls.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.
RESULTS: We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH-2 (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the mitochondria were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per oxygen atom reduced to water by half in control cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH-2 should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Alessia Catania, Arcangela Iuso, Juliette Bouchereau, Laura S Kremer, Marina Paviolo, Caterina Terrile, Paule Bénit, Allan G Rasmusson, Thomas Schwarzmayr, Valeria Tiranti, Pierre Rustin, Malgorzata Rak, Holger Prokisch, Manuel Schiff<br><b>Journal:</b> Orphanet J Rare Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1750-1172<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.589<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665043">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors in Neuroscience Research.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) are increasingly useful preclinical tools in neuroscience research studies for interrogating cellular and neurocircuit functions and mapping brain connectivity.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore associated with various age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), wherein accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria has been reported as an early symptom further contributing to disease progression. In AD, impairment of mitochondrial function causes bioenergetic deficiency, intracellular calcium imbalance and oxidative stress, thereby aggravating the effect of Aβ and tau pathologies, leading to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and memory loss. Although there are reports suggesting intricate parallelism between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathologies such as Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation, the factors that drive the pathogenesis of either are unclear. In addition, emerging evidence suggest that mitochondrial quality control (QC) mechanisms such as mitophagy are impaired in AD. As an important mitochondrial QC mechanism, mitophagy plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health and function. Studies show that various proteins involved in mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis are affected in AD. Compromised mitophagy may also be attributed to impairment in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and defects in lysosomal acidification. Therapeutic interventions aiming to restore mitophagy functions can be used as a strategy for ameliorating AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence implicates the role of microglial activation via mitophagy induction in reducing amyloid plaque load.

Particularly vitamin B1 (thiamine), B6 (pyridoxine), and B12 (cobalamin) contribute essentially to the maintenance of a healthy nervous system. Their importance is highlighted by many neurological diseases related to deficiencies in one or more of these vitamins, but they can improve certain neurological conditions even without a (proven) deficiency.
AIM: This review focuses on the most important biochemical mechanisms, how they are linked with neurological functions and what deficits arise from malfunctioning of these pathways.
DISCUSSION: We discussed the main role of B Vitamins on several functions in the peripheral and central nervous system (PNS and CNS) including cellular energetic processes, antioxidative and neuroprotective effects, and both myelin and neurotransmitter synthesis. We also provide an overview of possible biochemical synergies between thiamine, pyridoxine, and cobalamin and discuss by which major roles each of them may contribute to the synergy and how these functions are inter-related and complement each other.
CONCLUSION: Taking into account the current knowledge on the neurotropic vitamins B1, B6, and B12, we conclude that a biochemical synergy becomes apparent in many different pathways in the nervous system, particularly in the PNS as exemplified by their combined use in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Alberto Calderón-Ospina, Mauricio Orlando Nava-Mesa<br><b>Journal:</b> CNS Neurosci Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1755-5949<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.46<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.122<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490017">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A novel strategy to enhance terpenoids production using cambial meristematic cells of <br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: None

These molecules play critical roles from embryogenesis to adult stages; therefore, alterations such as abnormal expression or mutations of the genes involved and their downstream factors cause a variety of genetic disorders at different stages. The Hh family involves many signaling mediators and functions through complex mechanisms, and achieving a comprehensive understanding of the entire signaling system is challenging. This review discusses the signaling mediators of the Hh pathway and their functions at the cellular and organismal levels. We first focus on the roles of Hh signaling mediators in signal transduction at the cellular level and the networks formed by these factors. Then, we analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of expression of Hh pathway molecules in tissues and organs, and describe the phenotypes of mutant mice. Finally, we discuss the genetic disorders caused by malfunction of Hh signaling-related molecules in humans.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Noriaki Sasai, Michinori Toriyama, Toru Kondo<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-8021<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.888<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781166">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Computational Analysis of nsSNPs of <br><b>Abstract:</b> Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiency (PID), characterized by fatal opportunistic infections.

Our objective was to evaluate protective effects of acupuncture treatment and potential underlying mechanisms according to the "gut-brain axis" theory.
Methods: We employed a 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model. The effects of acupuncture on disease development were assessed by behavioural tests and immunohistochistry (IHC). ELISA, qPCR and western blot (WB) were employed to measure inflammatory parameters and Fe metabolism in the substantia nigra (SN), striatum, duodenum and blood, respectively.
Results: Our data show that acupuncture can significantly increase the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), compared with untreated and madopa treated rats (
Conclusions: Acupuncture can reduce iron accumulation in the SN and protect the loss of dopamine neurons by promoting balanced expression of the iron importer DMT1 and the iron exporter Fpn1.

To guide their application across disease models, and to inspire the development of translational gene therapy vectors for targeting neurological diseases in humans, we sought to elucidate the host factors responsible for the CNS tropism of the AAV-PHP.B vectors. Leveraging CNS tropism differences across 13 mouse strains, we systematically determined a set of genetic variants that segregate with the permissivity phenotype, and rapidly identified LY6A as an essential receptor for the AAV-PHP.B vectors. Interfering with LY6A by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Ly6a disruption or with blocking antibodies reduced transduction of mouse brain endothelial cells by AAV-PHP.eB, while ectopic expression of Ly6a increased AAV-PHP.eB transduction of HEK293T and CHO cells by 30-fold or more. Importantly, we demonstrate that this newly discovered mode of AAV binding and transduction can occur independently of other known AAV receptors.

Methylome refers to the entire set of methylation modifications present in the whole genome. Over the last several years, an increasing number of reports on brain DNA methylome reported the association between aberrant methylation and the abnormalities in the expression of critical genes known to have critical roles during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, the role of methylation in understanding neurodegenerative diseases has been under focus. This review outlines the current knowledge of the human brain DNA methylomes during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the differentially methylated genes from fetal stage to old age and their biological functions. Additionally, we summarize the key aspects and methylated genes identified from brain methylome studies on neurodegenerative diseases. The brain methylome studies could provide a basis for studying the functional aspects of neurodegenerative diseases.

Identifying new strategies to protect these cells from degeneration and retain striatal dopaminergic innervation is therefore of great importance. Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are recognised contributors to the inhibitory extracellular milieu known to hinder tissue recovery following CNS damage. Digestion of these molecules by the bacterial lyase chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has been shown to promote functional recovery in animal models of neurological injury. Although ChABC has been shown to promote sprouting of dopaminergic axons following transection of the nigrostriatal pathway, its ability to protect against nigrostriatal degeneration in a toxin-based module with better construct validity for PD has yet to be explored. Here we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of ChABC treatment in the full and partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion mouse models of PD.
RESULTS: In mice bearing a full 6-OHDA lesion, ChABC treatment failed to protect against the loss of either nigral cells or striatal terminals. In contrast, in mice bearing a partial 6-OHDA lesion, ChABC treatment significantly protected cells of the rostral SNc, which remained at more than double the numbers seen in vehicle-treated animals. In the partial lesion model, ChABC treatment also significantly preserved dopaminergic fibres of the rostral dorsal striatum which increased from 15.3 ± 3.5% of the intact hemisphere in saline-treated animals to 36.3 ± 6.5% in the ChABC-treated group. These protective effects of ChABC treatment were not accompanied by improvements in either the cylinder or amphetamine-induced rotations tests of motor function.
CONCLUSIONS: ChABC treatment provided significant protection against a partial 6-OHDA lesion of the nigrostriatal tract although the degree of protection was not sufficient to improve motor outcomes. These results support further investigations into the benefits of ChABC treatment for providing neuroprotection in PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Edward J R Fletcher, Lawrence D F Moon, Susan Duty<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2202<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.57<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.017<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862005">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Molecular and Cellular Response of Co-cultured Cells toward Cobalt Chloride (CoCl<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cobalt chloride (CoCl<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Vinay Kumar Tripathi, Sivakumar Allur Subramaniyan, Inho Hwang<br><b>Journal:</b> ACS Omega<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2470-1343<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.55<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.754<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867478">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cytochalasin-B-Inducible Nanovesicle Mimics of Natural Extracellular Vesicles That Are Capable of Nucleic Acid Transfer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Extracellular vesicles provide cell-to-cell communication and have great potential for use as therapeutic carriers.

While the beneficial effects of such cell-based therapy have already been documented in terms of neurodegeneration of various origins, a neurophysiological basis for improvement in the recovery of neurological function is still not completely understood. This overview briefly describes the cumulative evidence from electrophysiological studies of NSC-derived neurons, aimed at establishing the maturation of differentiated neurons within a host microenvironment, and their integration into the host circuits, with a particular focus on the neurogenesis of NSC grafts within the post-ischemic milieu. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that the host microenvironment largely regulates the lineage of NSC grafts.

A recent example of the utility of this animal model is the promising myotubularin gene delivery in boys affected by X-linked centronuclear myopathy after successful systemic, long-term efficient gene therapy in Labrador retrievers. Mostly, this is due to unique features that make dogs an optimal system. The continuous emergence of spontaneous inherited disorders enables the identification of reliable complementary molecular models for human neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). Dogs' characteristics including size, lifespan and unprecedented medical care level allow a comprehensive longitudinal description of diseases. Moreover, the highly similar pathogenic mechanisms with human patients yield to translational robustness. Finally, interindividual phenotypic heterogeneity between dogs helps identifying modifiers and anticipates precision medicine issues.This review article summarizes the present list of molecularly characterized dog models for NMDs and provides an exhaustive list of the clinical and paraclinical assays that have been developed. This toolbox offers scientists a sensitive and reliable system to thoroughly evaluate neuromuscular function, as well as efficiency and safety of innovative therapies targeting these NMDs. This review also contextualizes the model by highlighting its unique genetic value, shaped by the long-term coevolution of humans and domesticated dogs. Because the dog is one of the most protected research animal models, there is considerable opposition to include it in preclinical projects, posing a threat to the use of this model. We thus discuss ethical issues, emphasizing that unlike many other models, the dog also benefits from its contribution to comparative biomedical research with a drastic reduction in the prevalence of morbid alleles in the breeding stock and an improvement in medical care.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Inès Barthélémy, Christophe Hitte, Laurent Tiret<br><b>Journal:</b> J Neuromuscul Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2214-3602<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.44<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450509">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Identification of target genes in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury in rats.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common neurological emergency observed in hospitals.

Methods: An integrated analysis was performed using published RNA-sequencing studies to determine TBI-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

At present, the lack of effective treatment is a critical issue. Amentoflavone (AF), which can inhibit cold stress-induced inflammation in lung by multiple mechanisms, is the main therapeutic ingredient in plants of the genus Selaginella.
RESULTS: In the current study, we found that cold could induce lung inflammation related to the complement system and its downstream pathways. AF treatment significantly inhibited lung inflammation from cold exposure. We presented evidence that AF can bind to complement component 3 (C3) to regulate inflammation-related pathways involving Lck/Yes novel tyrosine kinase (Lyn), protein kinase B (Akt), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and immune factors. Moreover, 30 mg/kg of AF caused significantly greater improvement than 15 mg/kg in reducing the level of C3 in lung tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: AF can protect lung tissue from cold exposure. The protective effect may be achieved by inhibition of C3 and negative regulation of the B cell receptor (BCR)/NF-κB signaling pathways and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which ultimately ameliorates the inflammatory response.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-31<br><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Cai, Chunyang Zhao, Yajie Du, Yuan Huang, Qingchun Zhao<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Immunol.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2172<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.984<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31888465">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Therapeutic Strategies for Attenuation of Retinal Ganglion Cell Injury in Optic Neuropathies: Concepts in Translational Research and Therapeutic Implications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is the central and irreversible endpoint of optic neuropathies. Current management of optic neuropathies and glaucoma focuses on intraocular pressure-lowering treatment which is insufficient. As such, patients are effectively condemned to irreversible visual impairment. This review summarizes experimental treatments targeting RGCs over the last decade. In particular, we examine the various treatment modalities and determine their viability and limitations in translation to clinical practice. Experimental RGC treatment can be divided into (1) cell replacement therapy, (2) neuroprotection, and (3) gene therapy. For cell replacement therapy, difficulties remain in successfully integrating transplanted RGCs from various sources into the complex neural network of the human retina. However, there is significant potential for achieving full visual restoration with this technique. Neuroprotective strategies, in the form of pharmacological agents, nutritional supplementation, and neurotrophic factors, are viable strategies with encouraging results from preliminary noncomparative interventional case series. It is important to note, however, that most published studies are focused on glaucoma, with few treating optic neuropathies of other etiologies. Gene therapy, through the use of viral vectors, has shown promising results in clinical trials, particularly for diseases with specific genetic mutations like Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. This treatment technique can be further extended to nonhereditary diseases, through transfer of genes promoting cell survival and neuroprotection.

Methods: A PubMed/MEDLINE-based systematic review has been performed combining the main Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) regarding the cell- and tissue-based therapies with the "Brain", "Spinal Cord", "Spine" and "Skull" MeSH terms. Only articles in English published in the last 10 years and pertinent to neurosurgery have been selected.
Results: A total of 1,173 relevant articles have been chosen. Somatic cells and gene-modification technologies have undergone the greatest development. Immunotherapies and gene therapies have been tested for the cure of glioblastoma, stem cells mainly for brain and spinal cord traumatic injuries. Stem cells have also found a rationale in the treatment of the cranial and spinal bony defects, and of the intervertebral disc degeneration, as well.Most of the completed or ongoing trials concerning the cell-based therapies in neurosurgery are on phase 2. Future perspectives involve the need to overcome issues related to immunogenicity, oncogenicity and routes for administration. Refinement and improvement of vector design and delivery are required within the gene therapies.

Mechanical activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channels contributes to the development of pulmonary vascular disease, and overexpression of the high homology (HH) domain of the TRPV4-associated transmembrane protein CD98 has been shown to inhibit this pathway. Here, we describe the development of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the CD98 HH domain in which the AAV serotypes and promoters have been optimized for efficient and specific delivery to pulmonary cells. AAV-mediated gene delivery of the CD98 HH domain inhibited TRPV4 mechanotransduction in a specific manner and protected against pulmonary vascular leakage in a human lung Alveolus-on-a-Chip model. As AAV has been used clinically to deliver other gene therapies, these data raise the possibility of using this type of targeted approach to develop mechanotherapeutics that target the TRPV4 pathway for treatment of pulmonary edema in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Juan Li, Amy M Wen, Ratnakar Potla, Ezekiel Benshirim, Ariel Seebarran, Maximilian A Benz, Olivier Y F Henry, Benjamin D Matthews, Rachelle Prantil-Baun, Sarah E Gilpin, Oren Levy, Donald E Ingber<br><b>Journal:</b> APL Bioeng<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-2877<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803860">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Take the shortcut - direct conversion of somatic cells into induced neural stem cells and their biomedical applications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Second-generation reprogramming of somatic cells directly into the cell type of interest avoids induction of pluripotency and subsequent cumbersome differentiation procedures. Several recent studies have reported direct conversion of human somatic cells into stably proliferating induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). Importantly, iNSCs are easier, faster, and more cost-efficient to generate than induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also have a higher level of clinical safety. Stably, self-renewing iNSCs can be derived from different cellular sources, such as skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and readily differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages that are indistinguishable from their iPSC-derived counterparts or from NSCs isolated from primary tissues. This review focuses on the derivation and characterization of iNSCs and their biomedical applications. We first outline different approaches to generate iNSCs and then discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, we summarize the preclinical validation of iNSCs to highlight that these cells are promising targets for disease modeling, autologous cell therapy, and precision medicine.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Anita Erharter, Sandra Rizzi, Jerome Mertens, Frank Edenhofer<br><b>Journal:</b> FEBS Lett.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1873-3468<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663609">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves Amyloid-β Pathology by Modifying Microglial Function and Suppressing Oxidative Stress.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are increasingly being studied as a source of cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, and several groups have reported their beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study using AD model mice (APdE9), we found that transplantation of MSC via the tail vein improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze test. Using electron paramagnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the in vivo redox state of the brain, we found that MSC transplantation suppressed oxidative stress in AD model mice. To elucidate how MSC treatment ameliorates oxidative stress, we focused on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and microglial function. MSC transplantation reduced Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. Transplantation of MSC also decreased Iba1-positive area in the cortex and reduced activated ameboid shaped microglia. On the other hand, MSC transplantation accelerated accumulation of microglia around Aβ deposits and prompted microglial Aβ uptake and clearance as shown by higher frequency of Aβ-containing microglia. MSC transplantation also increased CD14-positive microglia in vivo, which play a critical role in Aβ uptake. To confirm the effects of MSC on microglia, we co-cultured the mouse microglial cell line MG6 with MSC. Co-culture with MSC enhanced Aβ uptake by MG6 cells accompanied by upregulation of CD14 expression. Additionally, co-culture of MG6 cells with MSC induced microglial phenotype switching from M1 to M2 and suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that MSC treatment has the potential to ameliorate oxidative stress through modification of microglial functions, thereby improving Aβ pathology in AD model mice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Yokokawa, Naotoshi Iwahara, Shin Hisahara, Miho C Emoto, Taro Saito, Hiromi Suzuki, Tatsuo Manabe, Akihiro Matsumura, Takashi Matsushita, Syuuichirou Suzuki, Jun Kawamata, Hideo Sato-Akaba, Hirotada G Fujii, Shun Shimohama<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

Despite recent studies suggesting that diminished protein synthesis rates may contribute to neurologic disorders, a direct link between protein synthesis rates and the progression of neurodegeneration has not been established. Moreover, it remains unclear whether reduced protein synthesis could be involved in retinal pathogenesis. Dysregulation of AKT/mTOR signaling has been reported in the retina during retinal degeneration, but to what extent this signaling contributes to translational attenuation in these mice remains uncertain.
Methods: C57BL/6J and rd16 mice were subcutaneously injected with anisomycin to chronically inhibit protein synthesis rates. An AAV2 construct encoding constitutively active 4ebp1 was subretinally delivered in wildtype animals to lower protein synthesis rates. 4ebp1/2 were knocked out in rd16 mice.
Results: Anisomycin treatment lowered retinal translation rates, accelerated retinal degeneration in rd16 mice, and initiated cell death in the retinas of C57BL/6J mice. AAV-mediated transfer of constitutively active 4ebp1-4A into the subretinal space of wildtype animals inhibited protein synthesis, and led to reduced electroretinography amplitudes and fewer ONL nuclei. Finally, we report that restoring protein synthesis rates by knocking out 4ebp1/2 was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in rhodopsin levels and a delay in retinal degeneration in rd16 mice.
Conclusions: Our study indicates that protein synthesis inhibition is likely not a cell defense mechanism in the retina by which deteriorating photoreceptors survive, but may be harmful to degenerating retinas, and that restoring protein synthesis may have therapeutic potential in delaying the progression of retinal degeneration.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Christopher R Starr, Cyril N A Nyankerh, Xiaoping Qi, Yang Hu, Oleg S Gorbatyuk, Nahum Sonenberg, Michael E Boulton, Marina S Gorbatyuk<br><b>Journal:</b> Invest.

With the discovery of bacteriorhodopsin, a light-sensitive bacterial protein, in 1971 Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius laid the pavement of optogenetics. However, the cross-integration of different disciplines is a little more than a decade old. The toolbox contains fluorescent sensors and optogenetic actuators that enable visualization of signaling events and manipulation of cellular activities, respectively. Neuropathic pain is pain caused either by damage or disease that affects the somatosensory system. The exact mechanism for neuropathic pain is not known, however proposed mechanisms include immune reactions, ion channel expressions, and inflammation. Current regimen for the disease provides about 50% relief for only 40-60% of patients. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic applications of optogenetics by manipulating the activity of neurons. This review summarizes the basic concept, therapeutic applications for neuropathy, and potential of optogenetics to reach from bench to bedside in the near future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Kang Liu, Long Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> Bosn J Basic Med Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1840-4812<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995901">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Regulation of Nrf2 Signaling.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Regulation of antioxidant gene expression is essential for controlling oxidative stress and maintaining physiological homeostasis. In this context, the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been identified as the chief regulator of the transcription of diverse antioxidant genes as well as many other cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 activity is subjected to the regulation at various levels including protein stability, transcription, and post-transcription. Among the various regulatory pathways, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 axis is the most prominent regulator of Nrf2 activity. Being a tightly controlled transcriptional activator of antioxidant genes, Nrf2 signaling is intimately involved in health and disease. While Nrf2 is a protector against oxidative and electrophilic tissue injury, persistent activation of Nrf2 signaling may also contribute to disease pathophysiology, such as cancer progression.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Robert Li, Zhenquan Jia, Hong Zhu<br><b>Journal:</b> React Oxyg Species (Apex)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2380-2367<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692987">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Companies</h2> <br><br><b>Company Name:</b> Voyager Therapeutics, Inc.<br><b>Overview:</b> Voyager Therapeutics is developing life-changing gene therapies from discovery, preclinical and clinical development, through to commercialization.
