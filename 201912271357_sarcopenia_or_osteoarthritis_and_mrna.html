METHODS: CD109 expression was examined in synovial tissues and FLSs from RA patients and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model mice. CD109-deficient mice were developed to evaluate the severity of CIA. Small interfering RNAs and a neutralising antibody against CD109 (anti-CD109) were designed for functional or treatment studies in RA FLSs and CIA.
RESULTS: CD109 was found to be abundantly expressed in the synovial tissues from RA patients and CIA mice. CD109 expression in RA FLSs was upregulated by inflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α. Silencing of CD109 or anti-CD109 treatment reduced proinflammatory factor production, cell migration, invasion, chemoattractive potential and osteoclast differentiation, thereby reducing the deleterious inflammatory response of RA FLSs in vitro. Mice lacking CD109 were protected against arthritis in the CIA model. Anti-CD109 treatment prevented the onset and ameliorated the severity of CIA lesions.
CONCLUSION: Our study uncovers an antiarthritic role for CD109 and suggests that CD109 inhibition might serve as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for RA.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-28<br><b>Authors:</b> Guanhua Song, Tingting Feng, Ru Zhao, Qiqi Lu, Yutao Diao, Qingwei Guo, Zhaoxia Wang, Yuang Zhang, Luna Ge, Jihong Pan, Lin Wang, Jinxiang Han<br><b>Journal:</b> Ann.

Less is known on pathological age-related muscle wasting and weakness termed sarcopenia, which directly impacts physical autonomy and survival. Here, we compare genome-wide transcriptional changes of sarcopenia versus age-matched controls in muscle biopsies from 119 older men from Singapore, Hertfordshire UK and Jamaica. Individuals with sarcopenia reproducibly demonstrate a prominent transcriptional signature of mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction in skeletal muscle, with low PGC-1α/ERRα signalling, and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial proteostasis genes.

We characterized the CRC-associated microbiota and investigated whether cachexia affects the microbiota composition. Further, we examined the possible relationship between the microbial surface molecule flagellin and CRC. CRC cells (C26) were inoculated into mice. Activin receptor (ACVR) ligands were blocked, either before tumor formation or before and after, to increase muscle mass and prevent muscle loss. The effects of flagellin on C26-cells were studied in vitro. The occurrence of similar phenomena were studied in murine and human tumors. Cancer modulated the gut microbiota without consistent effects of blocking the ACVR ligands. However, continued treatment for muscle loss modified the association between microbiota and weight loss.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Eleanna Kaffe, Christiana Magkrioti, Vassilis Aidinis<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancers (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6694<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.37<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.142<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Collagen Induces a More Proliferative, Migratory and Chemoresistant Phenotype in Head and Neck Cancer via DDR1.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and includes squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx and oral cavity. Patient prognosis has remained poor for decades and molecular targeted therapies are not in routine use. Here we showed that the overall expression of collagen subunit genes was higher in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) than normal fibroblasts. Focusing on collagen8A1 and collagen11A1, we showed that collagen is produced by both CAFs and tumour cells, indicating that HNSCCs are collagen-rich environments. We then focused on discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagen-activated receptor tyrosine kinase, and showed that it is over-expressed in HNSCC tissues. Further, we demonstrated that collagen promoted the proliferation and migration of HNSCC cells and attenuated the apoptotic response to cisplatin. Knockdown of DDR1 in HNSCC cells demonstrated that these tumour-promoting effects of collagen are mediated by DDR1. Our data suggest that specific inhibitors of DDR1 might provide novel therapeutic opportunities to treat HNSCC.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Sook Ling Lai, May Leng Tan, Robert J Hollows, Max Robinson, Maha Ibrahim, Sandra Margielewska, E Kenneth Parkinson, Anand Ramanathan, Rosnah Binti Zain, Hisham Mehanna, Rachel J Spruce, Wenbin Wei, Ivy Chung, Paul G Murray, Lee Fah Yap, Ian C Paterson<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancers (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6694<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.37<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.142<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31717573">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> CircRNA hsa_circ_0074834 promotes the osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling process in bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by acting as a ceRNA for miR-942-5p.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Bone tissue has a strong ability to repair itself. When treated properly, most fractures will heal well. However, some fractures are difficult to heal. When a fracture does not heal, it is called nonunion. Approximately, 5% of all fracture patients have difficulty healing. Because of the continuous movement of the fracture site, bone nonunion is usually accompanied by pain, which greatly reduces the quality of life of patients. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) play an important role in the process of nonunion. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique kind of noncoding RNA and represent the latest research hotspot in the RNA field. At present, no studies have reported a role of circRNAs in the development of nonunion. After isolation of BMSCs from patients with nonunion, the expression of circRNAs in these cells was detected by using a circRNA microarray. Alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin red staining were used to detect the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by hsa_circ_0074834. The target gene of hsa_circ_0074834 was detected by RNA pull-down and double-luciferase reporter assay. The ability of hsa_circ_0074834 to regulate the osteogenesis of BMSCs in vivo was tested by heterotopic osteogenesis and single cortical bone defect experiments. The results showed that the expression of hsa_circ_0074834 in BMSCs from patients with nonunion was decreased. Hsa_circ_0074834 acts as a ceRNA to regulate the expression of ZEB1 and VEGF through microRNA-942-5p. Hsa_circ_0074834 can promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the repair of bone defects. These results suggest that circRNAs may be a key target for the treatment of nonunion.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxiao Ouyang, Tingting Tan, Xianghong Zhang, Jia Wan, Yanling Zhou, Guangyao Jiang, Daishui Yang, Xiaoning Guo, Tang Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Death Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-4889<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.310<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31804461">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> eIF2α signaling regulates autophagy of osteoblasts and the development of osteoclasts in OVX mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis is induced chiefly by an imbalance of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Salubrinal is a synthetic compound that inhibits de-phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Phosphorylation of eIF2α alleviates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which may activate autophagy. We hypothesized that eIF2α signaling regulates bone homeostasis by promoting autophagy in osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclast development. To test the hypothesis, we employed salubrinal to elevate the phosphorylation of eIF2α in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model and cell cultures. In the OVX model, salubrinal prevented abnormal expansion of rough ER and decreased the number of acidic vesiculars. It regulated ER stress-associated signaling molecules such as Bip, p-eIF2α, ATF4 and CHOP, and promoted autophagy of osteoblasts via regulation of eIF2α, Atg7, LC3, and p62. Salubrinal markedly alleviated OVX-induced symptoms such as reduction of bone mineral density and bone volume fraction. In primary bone-marrow-derived cells, salubrinal increased the differentiation of osteoblasts, and decreased the formation of osteoclasts by inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Live cell imaging and RNA interference demonstrated that suppression of osteoclastogenesis is in part mediated by Rac1 GTPase. Collectively, this study demonstrates that ER stress-autophagy axis plays an important role in OVX mice. Bone-forming osteoblasts are restored by maintaining phosphorylation of eIF2α, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts are regulated by inhibiting NFATc1 and Rac1 GTPase.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Jie Li, Xinle Li, Daquan Liu, Kazunori Hamamura, Qiaoqiao Wan, Sungsoo Na, Hiroki Yokota, Ping Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Death Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-4889<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.310<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801950">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Progranulin deficiency exacerbates spinal cord injury by promoting neuroinflammation and cell apoptosis in mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in significant and catastrophic dysfunction and disability and imposes a huge economic burden on society.

Long non-coding RNAs play critical roles in various biological processes of tumors; however, the function of these in BTB permeability is still unclear. In this study, we have identified that long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 174 (linc00174) was upregulated in glioma endothelial cells (GECs) from glioma tissues. Additionally, linc00174 was also upregulated in GECs from the BTB model in vitro. Knock down of linc00174 increased BTB permeability and reduced the expression of the tight junction-related proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5. Both bioinformatics data and results of luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that linc00174 regulated BTB permeability by binding to miR-138-5p and miR-150-5p. Furthermore, knock down of linc00174 inhibited FOSL2 expression via upregulating miR-138-5p and miR-150-5p. FOSL2 interacted with the promoter regions and upregulated the promoter activity of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-5, and linc00174 in GECs.

These IL-36 cytokines function through a common receptor to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-36 cytokines are expressed as inactive precursors and require proteolytic processing to become fully active. Upon binding to IL-36R, IL-36 agonists augment the expression and production of inflammatory cytokines via activating signaling pathways. IL-36 is mainly expressed in epidermal, bronchial, and intestinal epithelial cells that form the barrier structures of the body and regulates the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production at these tissue sites. Dysregulation of IL-36 signaling is a major etiological factor in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Besides its critical role in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis, emerging evidence suggests that aberrant IL-36 activities also promote inflammatory diseases in the lung, kidneys, and intestines, underscoring the potential of IL-36 as a therapeutic target for common inflammatory diseases. The role of IL-36 signaling in cancer development is also under investigation, with limited studies suggesting a potential anti-tumor effect.

Under the inflammatory environment of RA, activated macrophages revealed increased expression of folate receptor and elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. In this study, we successfully conjugated folate to polyethylene glycol 100 monostearate as film-forming material and further prepared methotrexate (MTX) and catalase (CAT) co-encapsulated liposomes, herein, shortened to FOL-MTX&CAT-L, that could actively target to activated macrophages. Thereafter, elevated intracellular hydrogen peroxide, the main source of ROS, diffused into liposomes and encapsulated CAT catalyzed the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. Continuous oxygen-generation inside liposomes would eventually disorganize its structure and release the encapsulated MTX. We characterized the in vitro drug release, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies as well as in vivo pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy and safety studies of FOL-MTX&CAT-L. In vitro results revealed that FOL-MTX&CAT-L possessed sufficient ROS-sensitive drug release, displayed an improved cellular uptake through folate-mediated endocytosis and exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect on activated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, in vivo results showed prolonged blood circulation time of PEGylated liposomes, enhanced accumulation of MTX in inflamed joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, reinforced therapeutic efficacy and minimal toxicity toward major organs. These results imply that FOL-MTX&CAT-L may be used as an effective nanomedicine system for RA treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Minglei Chen, Kambere Daddy Amerigos J C, Zhigui Su, Nida El Islem Guissi, Yanyu Xiao, Li Zong, Qineng Ping<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmaceutics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1999-4923<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.74<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.091<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698794">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> LncRNA KLF3-AS1 in human mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes ameliorates pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes and myocardial infarction through miR-138-5p/Sirt1 axis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> AIM: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a severe disease with increased mortality and disability rates, posing heavy economic burden for society. Exosomes were uncovered to mediate intercellular communication after MI. This study aims to explore the effect and mechanism of lncRNA KLF3-AS1 in exosomes secreted by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes and MI.
METHODS: Exosomes from hMSCs were isolated and identified. Exosomes from hMSCs with transfection of KLF3-AS1 for overexpression were injected into MI rat model or incubated with hypoxia cardiomyocytes. Effect of KLF3-AS1 on MI area, cell viability, apoptosis, and pyroptosis was determined. The relationship among miR-138-5p, KLF3-AS1, and Sirt1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Normal cardiomyocytes were transfected with miR-138-5p inhibitor or sh-Sirt1 to clarify whether alteration of miR-138-5p or sh-Sirt1 can regulate the effect of KLF3-AS1 on cardiomyocytes.
RESULTS: Exosomes from hMSCs were successfully extracted. Transfection of KLF3-AS1 exosome in rats and incubation with KLF3-AS1 exosome in hypoxia cardiomyocytes both verified that overexpression of KLF3-AS1 in exosomes leads to reduced MI area, decreased cell apoptosis and pyroptosis, and attenuated MI progression. KLF3-AS1 can sponge miR-138-5p to regulate Sirt1 expression. miR-138-5p inhibitor transfection and KLF3-AS1 exosome incubation contribute to attenuated pyroptosis and MI both in vivo and in vitro, while transfection of sh-Sirt1 could reverse the protective effect of exosomal KLF3-AS1 on hypoxia cardiomyocytes.

However, when stress-related injuries occur, a rapid and efficient regeneration of the tissues is necessary to maintain cartilage integrity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to exhibit high capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency effects, and thus play a pivotal role in the repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage. On the other hand, the influence of certain pathological conditions such as metabolic disorders on MSCs can seriously impair their regenerative properties and thus reduce their therapeutic potential.
OBJECTIVES: In this investigation, we attempted to improve and potentiate the in vitro chondrogenic ability of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal stem cells (ASCs) isolated from horses suffering from metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: Cultured cells in chondrogenic-inductive medium supplemented with Cladophora glomerata methanolic extract were experimented for expression of the main genes and microRNAs involved in the differentiation process using RT-PCR, for their morphological changes through confocal and scanning electron microscopy and for their physiological homeostasis.
RESULTS: The different added concentrations of C. glomerata extract to the basic chondrogenic inductive culture medium promoted the proliferation of equine metabolic syndrome ASCs (ASCs

Emblematic of this problem is the high-density micromass culture of embryonic limb bud mesenchymal cells, derived from chick, mouse, or rat. While estimated predictive value of this model system in toxicological studies is relatively high, important failures prevent its use by international regulatory agencies for toxicity testing and policy development. A likely underlying reason for the poor predictive capacity of animal-based culture models is the small but significant physiological differences between species. This deficiency has inspired investigators to develop more organotypic, 3-dimensional culture system using human cells to model normal tissue development and physiology and assess pharmacological and environmental toxicity.
METHODS: We have developed a modified, miniaturized micromass culture model using adult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (hBM-MPCs) that is amenable to moderate throughput and high content analysis to study chondrogenesis. The number of cells per culture was reduced, and a methacrylated gelatin (gelMA) overlay was incorporated to normalize the morphology of the cultures.
RESULTS: These modified human cell-based micromass cultures demonstrated robust chondrogenesis, indicated by increased Alcian blue staining and immunodetectable production of collagen type II and aggrecan, and stage-specific chondrogenic gene expression. In addition, in cultures of hBM-MPCs transduced with a lentiviral collagen type II promoter-driven GFP reporter construct, levels of GFP reporter activity correlated well with changes in endogenous collagen type II transcript levels, indicating the feasibility of non-invasive monitoring of chondrogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: The modified hBM-MPC micromass culture system described here represents a reproducible and controlled model for analyzing mechanisms of human skeletal development that may later be applied to pharmacological and environmental toxicity studies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Pirosa, Karen L Clark, Jian Tan, Shuting Yu, Yuanheng Yang, Rocky S Tuan, Peter G Alexander<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31842986">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The shift in the balance between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells mediated by glucocorticoid receptor.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into several tissues, such as bone, cartilage, and fat. Glucocorticoids affect a variety of biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of various cell types, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, or chondrocytes. Glucocorticoids exert their function by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Physiological concentrations of glucocorticoids stimulate osteoblast proliferation and promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, pharmacological concentrations of glucocorticoids can not only induce apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes but can also reduce proliferation and inhibit the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. Several signaling pathways, including the Wnt, TGFβ/BMP superfamily and Notch signaling pathways, transcription factors, post-transcriptional regulators, and other regulators, regulate osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis of MSCs mediated by GR. These signaling pathways target key transcription factors, such as Runx2 and TAZ for osteogenesis and PPARγ and C/EBPs for adipogenesis. Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis and osteoporosis are caused by various factors including dysfunction of bone marrow MSCs. Transplantation of MSCs is valuable in regenerative medicine for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and other skeletal disorders. However, the mechanism of inducing MSCs to differentiate toward the osteogenic lineage is the key to an efficient treatment. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the imbalance between GR-mediated osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis of MSCs would not only help us to identify the pathogenic causes of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis and osteoporosis but also promote future clinical applications for stem cell-based tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Here, we primarily review the signaling mechanisms involved in adipogenesis and osteogenesis mediated by GR and discuss the factors that control the adipo-osteogenic balance.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Lizhi Han, Bo Wang, Ruoyu Wang, Song Gong, Guo Chen, Weihua Xu<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31805987">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> In vitro study of cartilage tissue engineering using human adipose-derived stem cells induced by platelet-rich plasma and cultured on silk fibroin scaffold.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Cartilage tissue engineering is a promising technique for repairing cartilage defect. Due to the limitation of cell number and proliferation, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been developed as a substitute to chondrocytes as a cartilage cell-source. This study aimed to develop cartilage tissue from human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) cultured on a Bombyx mori silk fibroin scaffold and supplemented with 10% platelet-rich plasma (PRP).
METHODS: Human ADSCs and PRP were characterized. A silk fibroin scaffold with 500 μm pore size was fabricated through salt leaching. ADSCs were then cultured on the scaffold (ADSC-SS) and supplemented with 10% PRP for 21 days to examine cell proliferation, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and surface marker expression. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of type 2 collagen, aggrecan, and type 1 collagen was analysed. The presence of type 2 collagen confirming chondrogenesis was validated using immunocytochemistry. The negative and positive controls were ADSC-SS supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and ADSC-SS supplemented with commercial chondrogenesis medium, respectively.
RESULTS: Cells isolated from adipose tissue were characterized as ADSCs. Proliferation of the ADSC-SS PRP was significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to that of controls. Chondrogenesis was observed in ADSC-SS PRP and was confirmed through the increase in glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) secretion, the absence of mineral deposition, and increased surface marker proteins on chondrogenic progenitors. The mRNA expression of type 2 collagen in ADSC-SS PRP was significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to that in the negative control on days 7 and 21; however, aggrecan was significantly increased on day 14 compared to the controls. ADSC-SS PRP showed stable mRNA expression of type 1 collagen up to 14 days and it was significantly decreased on day 21. Confocal analysis showed the presence of type 2 collagen in the ADSC-SS PRP and positive control groups, with high distribution outside the cells forming the extracellular matrix (ECM) on day 21.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that ADSC-SS with supplemented 10% PRP medium can effectively support chondrogenesis of ADSCs in vitro and promising for further development as an alternative for cartilage tissue engineering in vivo.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Imam Rosadi, Karina Karina, Iis Rosliana, Siti Sobariah, Irsyah Afini, Tias Widyastuti, Anggraini Barlian<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801639">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Glucose regulates tissue-specific chondro-osteogenic differentiation of human cartilage endplate stem cells via O-GlcNAcylation of Sox9 and Runx2.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a major cause of low back pain. The physiological low-glucose microenvironment of the cartilage endplate (CEP) is disrupted in DDD. Glucose influences protein O-GlcNAcylation via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which is the key to stem cell fate. Thiamet-G is an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase for accumulating O-GlcNAcylated proteins while 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) inhibits HBP. Mechanisms of DDD are incompletely understood but include CEP degeneration and calcification. We aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms of glucose in CEP calcification in DDD.
METHODS: We assessed normal and degenerated CEP tissues from patients, and the effects of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of the CEP were determined by western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Cartilage endplate stem cells (CESCs) were induced with low-, normal-, and high-glucose medium for 21 days, and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiations were measured by Q-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining. CESCs were induced with low-glucose and high-glucose medium with or without Thiamet-G or DON for 21 days, and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiations were measured by Q-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining. Sox9 and Runx2 O-GlcNAcylation were measured by immunofluorescence. The effects of O-GlcNAcylation on the downstream genes of Sox9 and Runx2 were determined by Q-PCR and western blot.
RESULTS: Degenerated CEPs from DDD patients lost chondrogenesis, acquired osteogenesis, and had higher protein O-GlcNAcylation level compared to normal CEPs from LVF patients. CESC chondrogenic differentiation gradually decreased while osteogenic differentiation gradually increased from low- to high-glucose differentiation medium. Furthermore, Thiamet-G promoted CESC osteogenic differentiation and inhibited chondrogenic differentiation in low-glucose differentiation medium; however, DON acted opposite role in high-glucose differentiation medium. Interestingly, we found that Sox9 and Runx2 were O-GlcNAcylated in differentiated CESCs. Finally, O-GlcNAcylation of Sox9 and Runx2 decreased chondrogenesis and increased osteogenesis in CESCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the effect of glucose concentration on regulating the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential of CESCs and provide insight into the mechanism of how glucose concentration regulates Sox9 and Runx2 O-GlcNAcylation to affect the differentiation of CESCs, which may represent a target for CEP degeneration therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Chao Sun, Weiren Lan, Bin Li, Rui Zuo, Hui Xing, Minghan Liu, Jie Li, Yuan Yao, Junlong Wu, Yu Tang, Huan Liu, Yue Zhou<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31779679">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles: role in oncogenic processes, bioengineering potential, and technical challenges.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cellular-derived versatile transporters with a specialized property for trafficking a variety of cargo, including metabolites, growth factors, cytokines, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, throughout the microenvironment. EVs can act in a paracrine manner to facilitate communication between cells as well as modulate immune, inflammatory, regenerative, and remodeling processes. Of particular interest is the emerging association between EVs and stem cells, given their ability to integrate complex inputs for facilitating cellular migration to the sites of tissue injury. Additionally, stem cell-derived EVs can also act in an autocrine manner to influence stem cell proliferation, mobilization, differentiation, and self-renewal. Hence, it has been postulated that stem cells and EVs may work synergistically in the process of tissue repair and that dysregulation of EVs may cause a loss of homeostasis in the microenvironment leading to disease. By harnessing the property of EVs for delivery of small molecules, stem cell-derived EVs possess significant potential as a platform for developing bioengineering approaches for next-generation cancer therapies and targeted drug delivery methods. Although one of the main challenges of clinical cancer treatment remains a lack of specificity for the delivery of effective treatment options, EVs can be modified via genetic, biochemical, or synthetic methods for enhanced targeting ability of chemotherapeutic agents in promoting tumor regression. Here, we summarize recent research on the bioengineering potential of EV-based cancer therapies. A comprehensive understanding of EV modification may provide a novel strategy for cancer therapy and for the utilization of EVs in the targeting of oncogenic processes. Furthermore, innovative and emerging new technologies are shifting the paradigm and playing pivotal roles by continually expanding novel methods and materials for synthetic processes involved in the bioengineering of EVs for enhanced precision therapeutics.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Mujib Ullah, Yang Qiao, Waldo Concepcion, Avnesh S Thakor<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31771657">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Muscular Atrophy and Sarcopenia in the Elderly: Is There a Role for Creatine Supplementation?<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sarcopenia is characterized by a loss of muscle mass, quality, and function, and negatively impacts health, functionality, and quality of life for numerous populations, particularly older adults. Creatine is an endogenously produced metabolite, which has the theoretical potential to counteract many of the morphological and metabolic parameters underpinning sarcopenia. This can occur through a range of direct and indirect mechanisms, including temporal and spatial functions that accelerate ATP regeneration during times of high energy demand, direct anabolic and anti-catabolic functions, and enhanced muscle regenerating capacity through positively impacting muscle stem cell availability. Studies conducted in older adults show little benefit of creatine supplementation alone on muscle function or mass. In contrast, creatine supplementation as an adjunct to exercise training seems to augment the muscle adaptive response to the training stimulus, potentially through increasing capacity for higher intensity exercise, and/or by enhancing post-exercise recovery and adaptation. As such, creatine may be an effective dietary strategy to combat age-related muscle atrophy and sarcopenia when used to complement the benefits of exercise training.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Eimear Dolan, Guilherme G Artioli, Rosa Maria R Pereira, Bruno Gualano<br><b>Journal:</b> Biomolecules<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2218-273X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.65<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.525<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652853">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gene Expression Signature-Based Approach Identifies Antifungal Drug Ciclopirox As a Novel Inhibitor of HMGA2 in Colorectal Cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Human high-mobility group A2 (HMGA2) encodes for a non-histone chromatin protein which influences a variety of biological processes, including the cell cycle process, apoptosis, the DNA damage repair process, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The accumulated evidence suggests that high expression of HMGA2 is related to tumor progression, poor prognosis, and a poor response to therapy. Thus, HMGA2 is an important molecular target for many types of malignancies. Our recent studies revealed the positive connections between heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and HMGA2 and that the Hsp90 inhibitor has therapeutic potential to inhibit HMGA2-triggered tumorigenesis. However, 43% of patients suffered visual disturbances in a phase I trial of the second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922. To identify a specific inhibitor to target HMGA2, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000platform were both analyzed. We identified the approved small-molecule antifungal agent ciclopirox (CPX) as a novel potential inhibitor of HMGA2. In addition, CPX induces cytotoxicity of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells by induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo through direct interaction with the AT-hook motif (a small DNA-binding protein motif) of HMGA2. In conclusion, this study is the first to report that CPX is a novel potential inhibitor of HMGA2 using a drug-repurposing approach, which can provide a potential therapeutic intervention in CRC patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Min Huang, Chia-Hsiung Cheng, Shiow-Lin Pan, Pei-Ming Yang, Ding-Yen Lin, Kuen-Haur Lee<br><b>Journal:</b> Biomolecules<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2218-273X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.65<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.525<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684108">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Metformin Ameliorates Testicular Damage in Male Mice with Streptozotocin-Induced Type 1 Diabetes through the PK2/PKR Pathway.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Approximately 90% of male diabetes mellitus patients have varying degrees of testicular dysfunction.

These findings suggest that FFA may also play a role in inflammation-related joint damage and bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and OA. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze if and how FFA influence cells of bone metabolism in rheumatic diseases. When stimulated with FFA, osteoblasts from RA and OA patients secreted higher amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 and the chemokines IL-8, growth-related oncogene α, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin, and osteoblast differentiation markers were not influenced by FFA. Mineralization activity of osteoblasts correlated inversely with the level of FFA-induced IL-6 secretion. Expression of the Wnt signaling molecules, axin-2 and β-catenin, was not changed by palmitic acid (PA) or linoleic acid (LA), suggesting no involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway in FFA signaling for osteoblasts. On the other hand, Toll-like receptor 4 blockade significantly reduced PA-induced IL-8 secretion by osteoblasts, while blocking Toll-like receptor 2 had no effect. In osteoclasts, IL-8 secretion was enhanced by PA and LA particularly at the earliest time point of differentiation. Differences were observed between the responses of RA and OA osteoclasts. FFA might therefore represent a new molecular factor by which adipose tissue contributes to subchondral bone damage in RA and OA. In this context, their mechanisms of action appear to be dependent on inflammation and innate immune system rather than Wnt-RANKL pathways.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Klaus W Frommer, Rebecca Hasseli, Andreas Schäffler, Uwe Lange, Stefan Rehart, Jürgen Steinmeyer, Markus Rickert, Kerstin Sarter, Mario M Zaiss, Carsten Culmsee, Goutham Ganjam, Susanne Michels, Ulf Müller-Ladner, Elena Neumann<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849953">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Environmental Exposures and Asthma Development: Autophagy, Mitophagy, and Cellular Senescence.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Environmental pollutants and allergens induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to key features of allergic asthma.

A high fiber diet has been widely promoted for its ability to ameliorate inflammatory diseases. Fiber is fermented in the gut into short chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which enter the circulation providing systemic anti-inflammatory activities. Herein we show that mice fed a high fiber diet show a clear exacerbation of CHIKV arthropathy, with increased edema and neutrophil infiltrates. RNA-Seq analyses illustrated that a high fiber diet, in this setting, promoted a range of pro-neutrophil responses including Th17/IL-17. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses demonstrated significant similarities with mouse models of inflammatory psoriasis and significant depression of macrophage resolution phase signatures in the CHIKV arthritic lesions from mice fed a high fiber diet. Supplementation of the drinking water with butyrate also increased edema after CHIKV infection. However, the mechanisms involved were different, with modulation of AP-1 and NF-κB responses identified, potentially implicating deoptimization of endothelial barrier repair. Thus, neither fiber nor short chain fatty acids provided benefits in this acute infectious disease setting, which is characterized by widespread viral cytopathic effects and a need for tissue repair.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Natalie A Prow, Thiago D C Hirata, Bing Tang, Thibaut Larcher, Pamela Mukhopadhyay, Tiago Lubiana Alves, Thuy T Le, Joy Gardner, Yee Suan Poo, Eri Nakayama, Viviana P Lutzky, Helder I Nakaya, Andreas Suhrbier<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849947">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Emerging Roles of Extracellular Vesicles in Osteosarcoma.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous nanosized vesicles that are constitutively released by virtually all types of cells.

Increasing evidences suggest that EVs have a significant role in osteosarcoma (OS) development, progression, and metastatic process. The modulation of inflammatory communication pathways by EVs plays a critical role in OS and in other bone-related pathological conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

As in joint physiology and diseases such as OA, the synovial membrane (SM) of the joint capsule also plays a central role. We analyze the ability of SM to produce TFF compare healthy SM and its secretion product synovial fluid (SF) with SM and SF from patients suffering from OA or rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to measure the expression of TFFs in healthy SM and SM from patients suffering from OA or RA. For tissue localization, we investigated TFF1-3 in differently aged human SM of healthy donors by means of immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and Western blot.
RESULTS: Only TFF3 but not TFF1 and -2 was expressed in SM from healthy donors as well as cases of OA or RA on protein and mRNA level. In contrast, all three TFFs were detected in all samples of SF on the protein level. No significant changes were observed for TFF1 at all. TFF2 was significantly upregulated in RA samples in comparison to OA samples. TFF3 protein was significantly downregulated in OA samples in comparison to healthy samples and cases of RA significantly upregulated compared to OA. In contrast, in SM TFF3 protein was not significantly regulated.
CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate the production of TFF3 in SM. Unexpectedly, SF contains all three known TFF peptides. As neither articular cartilage nor SM produce TFF1 and TFF2, we speculate that these originate with high probability from blood serum.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Judith Popp, Martin Schicht, Fabian Garreis, Patricia Klinger, Kolja Gelse, Stefan Sesselmann, Michael Tsokos, Saskia Etzold, Dankwart Stiller, Horst Claassen, Friedrich Paulsen<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817054">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Endocannabinoid System in Pediatric Inflammatory and Immune Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptors, their endogenous ligands, and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. CB2, to a great extent, and CB1, to a lesser extent, are involved in regulating the immune response. They also regulate the inflammatory processes by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediator release and immune cell proliferation. This review provides an overview on the role of the endocannabinoid system with a major focus on cannabinoid receptors in the pathogenesis and onset of inflammatory and autoimmune pediatric diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, obesity, neuroinflammatory diseases, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

The purpose of present study is to investigate a role of vitamin D in muscle fat accumulation and mitochondrial changes. In differentiated C2C12 muscle cells, palmitic acid (PA) was pretreated, followed by incubation with 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) for 24 h. PA led to a significant increment of triglyceride (TG) levels with increased lipid peroxidation and cellular damage, which were reversed by 1,25(OH)2D. The supplementation of 1,25(OH)2D significantly enhanced PA-decreased mtDNA levels as well as mRNA levels involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in C2C12 myotubes. Additionally, 1,25(OH)2D significantly increased ATP levels and gene expression related to mitochondrial function such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and UCP3 and the vitamin D pathway including 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (CYP24) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27) in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. In addition to significant increment of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) mRNA expression, increased activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and SIRT1 was found in 1,25(OH)2D-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Thus, we suggest that the observed protective effect of vitamin D on muscle fat accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in a positive manner via modulating AMPK/SIRT1 activation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Chang, Yangha Kim<br><b>Journal:</b> Nutrients<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6643<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.493<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31744213">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cytokines in Inflammatory Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> This review aims to briefly discuss a short list of a broad variety of inflammatory cytokines.

Here we present a review of findings supporting the role of the abnormal HERVs activity in neurodevelopmental disorders. The derailment of brain development underlies numerous neuropsychiatric conditions, likely starting during prenatal life and carrying on during subsequent maturation of the brain. Autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and schizophrenia are neurodevelopmental disorders that arise clinically during early childhood or adolescence, currently attributed to the interplay among genetic vulnerability, environmental risk factors, and maternal immune activation. The role of HERVs in human embryogenesis, their intrinsic responsiveness to external stimuli, and the interaction with the immune system support the involvement of HERVs in the derailed neurodevelopmental process. Although definitive proofs that HERVs are involved in neurobehavioral alterations are still lacking, both preclinical models and human studies indicate that the abnormal expression of ERVs could represent a neurodevelopmental disorders-associated biological trait in affected individuals and their parents.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Emanuela Balestrieri, Claudia Matteucci, Chiara Cipriani, Sandro Grelli, Laura Ricceri, Gemma Calamandrei, Paola Sinibaldi Vallebona<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801288">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Role of Maresins in Inflammatory Pain: Function of Macrophages in Wound Regeneration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Although acute inflammatory responses are host-protective and generally self-limited, unresolved and delayed resolution of acute inflammation can lead to further tissue damage and chronic inflammation. The mechanism of pain induction under inflammatory conditions has been studied extensively; however, the mechanism of pain resolution is not fully understood. The resolution of inflammation is a biosynthetically active process, involving specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). In particular, maresins (MaRs) are synthesized from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by macrophages and have anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving capacities as well as tissue regenerating and pain-relieving properties. A new class of macrophage-derived molecules-MaR conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs)-has been reported to regulate phagocytosis and the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. Macrophages not only participate in the biosynthesis of SPMs, but also play an important role in phagocytosis. They exhibit different phenotypes categorized as proinflammatory M1-like phenotypes and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes that mediate both harmful and protective functions, respectively. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying macrophage functions and phenotypic changes have not yet been fully established. Recent studies report that MaRs help resolve inflammatory pain by enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and shifting cytokine release to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Consequently, this review elucidated the characteristics of MaRs and macrophages, focusing on the potent action of MaRs to enhance the M2 macrophage phenotype profiles that possess the ability to alleviate inflammatory pain.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Sung-Min Hwang, Gehoon Chung, Yong Ho Kim, Chul-Kyu Park<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766461">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MicroRNA-29a Exhibited Pro-Angiogenic and Anti-Fibrotic Features to Intensify Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Renovated Perfusion Recovery and Preventing against Fibrosis from Skeletal Muscle Ischemic Injury.<br><b>Abstract:</b> This study was conducted to elucidate whether <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Hong Su, Ching-Jen Wang, Yi-Yung Hung, Chun-Wun Lu, Chia-Yu Ou, Shun-Hung Tseng, Ching-Chin Tsai, Yun-Ting Kao, Pei-Chin Chuang<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766662">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Impact of Endurance and Resistance Training on Skeletal Muscle Glucose Metabolism in Older Adults.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Aging is associated with insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes.

Endurance and resistance exercise training have been endorsed as interventions to improve glucose tolerance and whole-body insulin sensitivity in the elderly. While both types of exercise generally increase insulin sensitivity in older adults, the metabolic pathways through which this occurs can differ and can be dependent on preexisting conditions including obesity and type 2 diabetes.

The course of these diseases involves chronic inflammation of joints and enthesopathies, which can result in joint damage and disability. Microparticles (MPs) are a group of small spherical membranous vesicles. The structure and cellular origin of MPs, mechanisms that stimulate their secretion and the place of their production, determine their biological properties, which could become manifest in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Microparticles can stimulate synovitis with proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. MPs may also contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases by the formation of immune complexes and complement activation, pro-coagulation activity, activation of vascular endothelium cells, and stimulation of metalloproteinase production. It seems that in the future, microparticles can become a modern marker of disease activity, a response to treatment, and, possibly, they can be used in the prognosis of the course of arthritis. The knowledge of the complexity of MPs biology remains incomplete and it requires further comprehensive studies to explain how they affect the development of rheumatic diseases.

A number of studies have focused on enhancing bone regeneration by applying mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or MSC-based bone tissue engineering strategies. However, translation of these approaches from basic research findings to clinical use has been hampered by the limited understanding of MSC therapeutic actions and complexities, as well as costs related to the manufacturing, regulatory approval, and clinical use of living cells and engineered tissues. More recently, a shift from the view of MSCs directly contributing to tissue regeneration toward appreciating MSCs as "cell factories" that secrete a variety of bioactive molecules and extracellular vesicles with trophic and immunomodulatory activities has steered research into new MSC-based, "cell-free" therapeutic modalities.

METHODS: In this multi-institutional collaboration, clinical characteristics of patients with primary resistance (defined as progression on initial computed tomography scan) were compared to patients with clinical benefit using Two sample t-test and Chi-square test (or Fisher's Exact test). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in all patients and the subsets of patients with clinical benefit or primary resistance. Cox's regression model was used to evaluate the correlation between survival endpoints and variables of interest. To explore clinical factors in a larger, independent patient sample, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed. RNAseq gene expression data as well as demographic and clinical information were downloaded for primary tumors of 517 patients included within TCGA-ccRCC.
RESULTS: Of 90 patients, 38 (42.2%) had primary resistance and 52 (57.8%) had clinical benefit. Compared with the cohort of patients with initial benefit, primary resistance was more likely to occur in patients with worse ECOG performance status (p = 0.03), earlier stage at diagnosis (p = 0.04), had no prior nephrectomy (p = 0.04) and no immune-related adverse events (irAE) (p = 0.02). In patients with primary resistance, improved OS was significantly correlated with lower International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk score (p = 0.02) and lower neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.04). In patients with clinical benefit, improved PFS was significantly associated with increased BMI (p = 0.007) and irAE occurrence (p = 0.02) while improved OS was significantly correlated with overweight BMI (BMI 25-30; p = 0.03) and no brain metastasis (p = 0.005). The cohort TCGA-ccRCC was examined for the correlations between gene expression patterns, clinical factors, and survival outcomes observing associations of T-cell inflammation and angiogenesis signatures with histologic grade, pathologic stage and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics including performance status, BMI and occurrence of an irAE associate with outcomes in patients with ccRCC treated with immunotherapy. The inverse association of angiogenesis gene signature with ccRCC histologic grade highlight opportunities for adjuvant combination VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor and immune-checkpoint inhibition.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Brian W Labadie, Ping Liu, Riyue Bao, Michael Crist, Ricardo Fernandes, Laura Ferreira, Scott Graupner, Andrew S Poklepovic, Ignacio Duran, Saman Maleki Vareki, Arjun V Balar, Jason J Luke<br><b>Journal:</b> J Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1479-5876<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.20<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.591<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767020">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Paeonol attenuates inflammation by targeting HMGB1 through upregulating miR-339-5p.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sepsis is a life-threatening disease caused by infection. Inflammation is a key pathogenic process in sepsis. Paeonol, an active ingredient in moutan cortex (a Chinese herb), has many pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory and antitumour actions. Previous studies have indicated that paeonol inhibits the expression of HMGB1 and the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. However, its underlying mechanism is still unknown. In this study, microarray assay and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results confirmed that paeonol could significantly up-regulate the expression of miR-339-5p in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS. Dual-luciferase assays indicated that miR-339-5p interacted with the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HMGB1. Western blot, immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses indicated that miR-339-5p mimic and siHMGB1 both negatively regulated the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., HMGB1, IL-1β and TNF-α) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Studies have confirmed that IKK-β is targeted by miR-339-5p, and we further found that paeonol could inhibit IKK-β expression. Positive mutual feedback between HMGB1 and IKK-β was observed when we silenced HMGB1 or IKK-β. These results indicated that paeonol could attenuate the inflammation mediated by HMGB1 and IKK-β by upregulating miR-339-5p expression. In addition, we constructed CLP model mice by cecal ligation and puncture. Paeonol was used to intervene to investigate its anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. The results showed that paeonol could improve the survival rate of sepsis mice and protect the kidney of sepsis mice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Liyan Mei, Meihong He, Chaoying Zhang, Jifei Miao, Quan Wen, Xia Liu, Qin Xu, Sen Ye, Peng Ye, Huina Huang, Junli Lin, Xiaojing Zhou, Kai Zhao, Dongfeng Chen, Jianhong Zhou, Chun Li, Hui Li<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852965">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> ERK1/2 drives IL-1β-induced expression of TGF-β1 and BMP-2 in torn tendons.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Diseased and injured tendons develop fibrosis, driven by factors including TGF-β, BMPs and CTGF. IL-1β and its signal transducer Erk1/2 are known to regulate TGF-β expression in animal tendons. We utilised tissues and cells isolated from patients with shoulder tendon tears and tendons of healthy volunteers to advance understanding of how inflammation induces fibrosis in diseased human tendons. ERK1/2 expression was reduced in torn (diseased) compared to healthy patient tendon tissues. We next investigated the fibrotic responses of tendon-derived cells isolated from healthy and diseased human tendon tissues in an inflammatory milieu. IL-1β treatment induced profound ERK1/2 signalling, TGFB1 and BMP2 mRNA expression in diseased compared to healthy tendon-derived cells. In the diseased cells, the ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) completely blocked the IL-1β-induced TGFB1 and partially reduced BMP2 mRNA expression. Conversely, the same treatment of healthy cells did not modulate IL-1β-induced TGFB1 or BMP2 mRNA expression. ERK1/2 inhibition did not attenuate IL-1β-induced CTGF mRNA expression in healthy or diseased tendon cells. These findings highlight differences between ERK1/2 signalling pathway activation and expression of TGF-β1 and BMP-2 between healthy and diseased tendon tissues and cells, advancing understanding of inflammation induced fibrosis during the development of human tendon disease and subsequent repair.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Wataru Morita, Sarah J B Snelling, Kim Wheway, Bridget Watkins, Louise Appleton, Andrew J Carr, Stephanie G Dakin<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831776">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Exploring inflammatory signatures in arthritic joint biopsies with Spatial Transcriptomics.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Lately it has become possible to analyze transcriptomic profiles in tissue sections with retained cellular context. We aimed to explore synovial biopsies from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients, using Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) as a proof of principle approach for unbiased mRNA studies at the site of inflammation in these chronic inflammatory diseases. Synovial tissue biopsies from affected joints were studied with ST. The transcriptome data was subjected to differential gene expression analysis (DEA), pathway analysis, immune cell type identification using Xcell analysis and validation with immunohistochemistry (IHC). The ST technology allows selective analyses on areas of interest, thus we analyzed morphologically distinct areas of mononuclear cell infiltrates. The top differentially expressed genes revealed an adaptive immune response profile and T-B cell interactions in RA, while in SpA, the profiles implicate functions associated with tissue repair. With spatially resolved gene expression data, overlaid on high-resolution histological images, we digitally portrayed pre-selected cell types in silico. The RA displayed an overrepresentation of central memory T cells, while in SpA effector memory T cells were most prominent. Consequently, ST allows for deeper understanding of cellular mechanisms and diversity in tissues from chronic inflammatory diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Carlberg, Marina Korotkova, Ludvig Larsson, Anca I Catrina, Patrik L Ståhl, Vivianne Malmström<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831833">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pannexin 3 ER Ca<br><b>Abstract:</b> Pannexin 3 (Panx3) is a regulator of bone formation.

Here, we investigated the effect of TNF inhibition alone on spinal progression when used during arthritis development in a murine model. We injected 8-week-old SKG mice with curdlan (curdlan group). We injected adalimumab at 3 and 9 weeks after the first curdlan injection (ADA group). The clinical scores of peripheral arthritis decreased in the ADA group at 3 weeks after first adalimumab injection. Using positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging and histologic examination, spinal inflammation was observed in the curdlan group, and was significantly deceased in the ADA group. However, spinal osteoblast activities by imaging using OsteoSense 680 EX and bone metabolism-related cytokines such as receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand, osteoprotegerin, Dickkopf-1, and sclerostin levels except IL-17A level were not different between the two groups. We conclude that treating TNF inhibitor alone reduced peripheral arthritis score and spinal inflammation in curdlan-injected SKG mice but did not decrease the spinal osteoblast activity, suggesting little effect on spinal ankylosis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Doo-Ho Lim, Eun-Ju Lee, Oh Chan Kwon, Seokchan Hong, Chang-Keun Lee, Bin Yoo, Jeehee Youn, Tae-Hwan Kim, Yong-Gil Kim<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31784598">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> In vivo delivery of VEGF RNA and protein to increase osteogenesis and intraosseous angiogenesis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Deficient bone vasculature is a key component in pathological conditions ranging from developmental skeletal abnormalities to impaired bone repair.

Fifty patients (0-15 years old) with IND-B were included in the study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all 50 patients and from 10 healthy asymptomatic children (controls). Rectal biopsies were collected from 29/50 patients; biopsy tissues were needle microdissected to isolate the different intestinal layers, for molecular analysis. Global miRNA expression was determined using TaqMan arrays. Correlation analysis between miRNA expression in plasma and biopsy samples as well as among tissues derived from the distinct intestinal layers was performed. Computational approaches were used for miRNA target prediction/identification of miRNA-regulated genes and enriched pathways biologically relevant to IND-B pathogenesis. miRNAs were statistically significantly deregulated (FC ≥ 2 and p ≤ 0.05) in submucosal and muscular layers: over-expressed (miR-146a and miR-146b) and under-expressed (miR-99a, miR-100, miR-130a, miR-133b, miR-145, miR-365, miR-374-5p, miR-451). Notably, let-7a-5p was highly over-expressed in patient plasma compared to healthy controls (FC = 17.4). In addition, miR-451 was significantly under-expressed in both plasma and all biopsy tissues from the same patients. Enriched pathways (p < 0.01) were axon guidance, nerve growth factor signalling, NCAM signalling for neurite out-growth, neuronal system and apoptosis. miRNA expression is deregulated in the submucosa and muscular layers of the rectum and detected in plasma from patients with IND-B.

Distinct expression levels of miRNAs, including miR-29b, have been detected in various biological fluids and tissues from a large variety of disease models. However, how miRNAs "react" and function in different cellular environments is still largely unknown. In this study, the regulation patterns of miR-29b between human and mouse cell lines were compared for the first time. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to stably knockdown miR-29b in human cancer HeLa cells and mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells with minimum off-targets. Genome editing revealed mir-29b-1, other than mir-29b-2, to be the main source of generating mature miR-29b. The editing of miR-29b decreased expression levels of its family members miR-29a/c via changing the tertiary structures of surrounding nucleotides. Comparing transcriptome profiles of human and mouse cell lines, miR-29b displayed common regulation pathways involving distinct downstream targets in macromolecular complex assembly, cell cycle regulation, and Wnt and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways; miR-29b also demonstrated specific functions reflecting cell characteristics, including fibrosis and neuronal regulations in NIH/3T3 cells and tumorigenesis and cellular senescence in HeLa cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Wenting Zhao, Lesley Cheng, Camelia Quek, Shayne A Bellingham, Andrew F Hill<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767948">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles for Therapeutic Applications in Bone Regeneration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Bone injuries and diseases constitute a burden both socially and economically, as the consequences of a lack of effective treatments affect both the patients' quality of life and the costs on the health systems. This impended need has led the research community's efforts to establish efficacious bone tissue engineering solutions. There has been a recent focus on the use of biomaterial-based nanoparticles for the delivery of therapeutic factors. Among the biomaterials being considered to date, calcium phosphates have emerged as one of the most promising materials for bone repair applications due to their osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity and their ability to be resorbed in the body. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have received particular attention as non-viral vectors for gene therapy, as factors such as plasmid DNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) and silencing RNA (siRNAs) can be easily incorporated on their surface. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles loaded with therapeutic factors have also been delivered to the site of bone injury using scaffolds and hydrogels. This review provides an extensive overview of the current state-of-the-art relating to the design and synthesis of calcium phosphate nanoparticles as carriers for therapeutic factors, the mechanisms of therapeutic factors' loading and release, and their application in bone tissue engineering.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Tanya J Levingstone, Simona Herbaj, Nicholas J Dunne<br><b>Journal:</b> Nanomaterials (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2079-4991<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.08<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.896<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698700">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Detection, identification, and quantification of oxidative protein modifications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Exposure of biological molecules to oxidants is inevitable and therefore commonplace.

Primary pharmacological strategies for the treatment of osteoporosis, hormone replacement treatment (HRT), and alendronate therapies may produce adverse side-effects and may not be recommended for long-term usage. Some classic and bone-specific natural Chinese medicine are very popularly used to treat osteoporosis and bone fracture effectively in clinical with their potential value in bone growth and development, but with few adverse side-effects. Current evidence suggests that the treatments appear to improve bone metabolism and attenuate the osteoporotic imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption at a cellular level by promoting osteoblast activity and inhibiting the effects of osteoclasts. The valuable therapies might, therefore, provide an effective and safer alternative to primary pharmacological strategies.

Vitamin D3 supplements or vitamin D3 fortified foods always have claims for bringing people health benefits including bone and muscle health. An up-to-date rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis is important to better understand the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on muscle strength.
METHODS: English written randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on muscle strength in healthy athletes were searched using three databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library). Serum 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL is considered to be sufficient in this systematic review and meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Five RCTs with 163 athletes (vitamin D3 n = 86, placebo n = 77) met inclusion criteria. Fourteen athletes were lost to follow-up and 149 athletes (vitamin D3 n = 80, placebo n = 69) were documented with complete result. Among athletes with baseline serum 25(OH)D values suggesting insufficiency, vitamin D3 daily dosage at 5000 IU for over 4 weeks led to a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 31.7 ng/mL. Athletes with sufficient serum 25(OH)D level at baseline were recruited in only one study, and the participants of which were assigned to either vitamin D3 at a daily dosage of 3570 IU or placebo for 12 weeks, their serum 25(OH)D sufficiency (VD: 37.2 ± 7.6 vs. 45.6 ± 7.6; PL: 38 ± 6.8 vs. 32 ± 8.4) was well maintained above the cut-off boundary. One repetition maximum Bench Press (1-RM BP) was not improved significantly (SMD 0.07, 95% CI: - 0.32 to 0.47, P = 0.72) and there was no significant increase in maximal quadriceps contraction (SMD -2.14, 95% CI: - 4.87 to 0.59, P = 0.12). Furthermore, there was no significant overall effect of vitamin D3 intervention on muscle strength in this meta-analysis (SMD -0.75, 95% CI: - 1.82 to 0.32, P = 0.17).
CONCLUSION: Although, serum 25(OH)D concentrations after supplementation reached sufficiency was observed, muscle strength did not significantly improve at this point of current meta-analysis. Additional well-designed RCTs with large number of participants examined for the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations, muscle strength in a variety of sports, latitudes and diverse multicultural populations are needed.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Qi Han, Xueyang Li, Qiushi Tan, Jing Shao, Muqing Yi<br><b>Journal:</b> J Int Soc Sports Nutr<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1550-2783<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.72<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.074<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31771586">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> None<br><b>Abstract:</b> The <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Raffaella Nenna, Arianna Turchetti, Gerarda Mastrogiorgio, Fabio Midulla<br><b>Journal:</b> Appl Clin Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-704X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.745<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31824186">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Editorial focus: understanding off-target effects as the key to successful RNAi therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> With the first RNA interference (RNAi) drug (ONPATTRO (patisiran)) on the market, we witness the RNAi therapy field reaching a critical turning point, when further improvements in drug candidate design and delivery pipelines should enable fast delivery of novel life changing treatments to patients.

Repeated skeletal muscle contraction induces the production and secretion of myokines, which have a wide range of functions in different tissues and organs. This new role of skeletal muscle as a secretory organ means skeletal muscle contraction could be a key player in the prevention and/or management of chronic disease. However, some individuals are not capable of optimal physical exercise in terms of adequate duration, intensity or muscles involved, and therefore they may be virtually deprived of at least some of the physiological benefits induced by exercise. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is emerging as an effective physical exercise substitute for myokine induction. NMES is safe and efficient and has been shown to improve muscle strength, functional capacity, and quality of life. This alternative exercise modality elicits hypertrophy and neuromuscular adaptations of skeletal muscles. NMES stimulates circulating myokine secretion, promoting a cascade of endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects. We review the current evidence supporting NMES as an effective physical exercise substitute for inducing myokine production and its potential applications in health and disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Sanchis-Gomar, Sergio Lopez-Lopez, Carlos Romero-Morales, Nicola Maffulli, Giuseppe Lippi, Helios Pareja-Galeano<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Physiol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-042X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.16<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.153<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849710">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Oxytocin/Osteocalcin/IL-6 and NGF/BDNF mRNA Levels in Response to Cold Stress Challenge in Mice: Possible Oxytonic Brain-Bone-Muscle-Interaction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Oxytocin (Oxt), osteocalcin (Ost), and NGF/BDNF have a role in bone homeostasis, reproduction, and cognition.

LINC00265 is a newly discovered LncRNA and its function in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown.
Methods: Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis were performed to investigate the expression, clinical significance and potential biologic functions of LINC00265 in CRC based on the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To further investigate the potential role of LINC00265 in CRC, we knocked down the LINC00265 expression in HT29 cells. The cell proliferation, invasion, cycle distribution, and apoptosis were evaluated in control, NC and siRNA groups. Additionally, effect of LINC00265 on the expression of EGFR was also measured.
Results: The expression level of LINC00265 is increased in CRC tissues. Elevated level of LINC00265 is correlated with lymph node metastases and advanced pathological stage. We obtained 269 LINC00265 related genes; the results of functional analysis of these genes revealed that LINC00265 might involve in carcinogenesis of CRC. In addition, further experiments indicated that LINC00265 knockdown impaired cell proliferation and invasion, promoted cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in HT29 cells. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed that downregulation of LINC00265 suppressed the expression of EGFR.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that LINC00265 induces cell proliferation, migration and inhibits CRC cells apoptosis by targeting EGFR. LINC00265 could be served as a diagnostic factor and therapeutic target for CRC patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Hua Ge, Yan Yan, Chaosen Yue, Chaojie Liang, Jixiang Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> Onco Targets Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-6930<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.09<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.986<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31824175">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Sal B Alleviates Myocardial Ischemic Injury by Inhibiting TLR4 and the Priming Phase of NLRP3 Inflammasome.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Salvianolic acid B is one of the main water-soluble components of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. Many reports have shown that it has significant anti-myocardial ischemia effect. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our present study demonstrated that Sal B could alleviate myocardial ischemic injury by inhibiting the priming phase of NLRP3 inflammasome. In vivo, serum c-troponin I (cTn), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, the cardiac function and infract size were examined. We found that Sal B could notably reduce the myocardial ischemic injury caused by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In vitro, Sal B down-regulated the TLR4/NF-κB signaling cascades in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated H9C2 cells. Furthermore, Sal B reduced the expression levels of IL-1β and NLRP3 inflammasome in a dose-dependent manner. In short, our study provided evidence that Sal B could attenuate myocardial ischemic injury via inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.

Differentiated C2C12 muscle cells were pretreated with tBHP, followed by 1,25(OH)2D for additional 24 h. An exogenous inducer of oxidative stress, tBHP significantly increased oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, intracellular damage, and cell death which were reversed by 1,25(OH)2D in C2C12 myotubes. 1.25(OH)2D improves tBHP-induced mitochondrial morphological changes such as swelling, irregular cristae, and smaller size and number, as observed by transmission electron microscope. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D treatment increases mtDNA contents as well as gene expression involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1α, NRF1, and Tfam. Significant increments in mRNA levels related to antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2, HMOX1, and TXNRD1, myogenic differentiation markers including myoglobin, muscle creatine kinase (MCK), and MHCІ and ІІ, and vitamin D metabolism such as CYP24, CYP27, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were found in 1,25(OH)2D-treated myotubes. Moreover, upon t-BHP-induced oxidative stress, significant incremental changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, activities of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtulin 1 (SIRT1), and SIRT1 expression were noted in 1,25(OH)2D-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Taken together, these results suggest the observed potent inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on muscle oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics might be at least involved in the activation of AMPK and SIRT1 activation in muscle cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Chang<br><b>Journal:</b> Molecules<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1420-3049<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.01<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.757<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671915">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The activating transcription factor 2: an influencer of cancer progression.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In contrast to the continuous increase in survival rates for many cancer entities, colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer are predicted to be ranked among the top 3 cancer-related deaths in the European Union by 2025. Especially, fighting metastasis still constitutes an obstacle to be overcome in CRC and pancreatic cancer. As described by Fearon and Vogelstein, the development of CRC is based on sequential mutations leading to the activation of proto-oncogenes and the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. In pancreatic cancer, genetic alterations also attribute to tumour development and progression. Recent findings have identified new potentially important transcription factors in CRC, among those the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). ATF2 is a basic leucine zipper protein and is involved in physiological and developmental processes, as well as in tumorigenesis. The mutation burden of ATF2 in CRC and pancreatic cancer is rather negligible; however, previous studies in other tumours indicated that ATF2 expression level and subcellular localisation impact tumour progression and patient prognosis. In a tissue- and stimulus-dependent manner, ATF2 is activated by upstream kinases, dimerises and induces target gene expression. Dependent on its dimerisation partner, ATF2 homodimers or heterodimers bind to cAMP-response elements or activator protein 1 consensus motifs. Pioneering work has been performed in melanoma in which the dual role of ATF2 is best understood. Even though there is increasing interest in ATF2 recently, only little is known about its involvement in CRC and pancreatic cancer. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of the underestimated 'cancer gene chameleon' ATF2 in apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and microRNA regulation and highlight its functions in CRC and pancreatic cancer. We further provide a novel ATF2 3D structure with key phosphorylation sites and an updated overview of all so-far available mouse models to study ATF2 in vivo.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Kerstin Huebner, Jan Procházka, Ana C Monteiro, Vijayalakshmi Mahadevan, Regine Schneider-Stock<br><b>Journal:</b> Mutagenesis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1464-3804<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.99<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.164<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31799611">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Ameliorating effects of Gö6976, a pharmacological agent that inhibits protein kinase D, on collagen-induced arthritis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling can contribute to the pathogenesis of arthritis. Disruption of TLR signaling at early stages of arthritis might thereby provide an opportunity to halt the disease progression and ameliorate outcomes. We previously found that Gö6976 inhibits TLR-mediated cytokine production in human and mouse macrophages by inhibiting TLR-dependent activation of protein kinase D1 (PKD1), and that PKD1 is essential for proinflammatory responses mediated by MyD88-dependent TLRs. In this study, we investigated whether PKD1 contributes to TLR-mediated proinflammatory responses in human synovial cells, and whether Gö6976 treatment can suppress the development and progression of type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in mouse. We found that TLR/IL-1R ligands induced activation of PKD1 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS). TLR/IL-1R-induced expression of cytokines/chemokines was substantially inhibited in Gö6976-treated HFLS and PKD1-knockdown HFLS. In addition, serum levels of anti-CII IgG antibodies, and the incidence and severity of arthritis after CII immunization were significantly reduced in mice treated daily with Gö6976. Synergistic effects of T-cell receptor and TLR, as well as TLR alone, on spleen cell proliferation and cytokine production were significantly inhibited in the presence of Gö6976. Our results suggest a possibility that ameliorating effects of Gö6976 on CIA may be due to its ability to inhibit TLR/IL-1R-activated PKD1, which might play an important role in proinflammatory responses in arthritis, and that PKD1 could be a therapeutic target for inflammatory arthritis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Tae Won Yoon, Young-In Kim, Hongsik Cho, David D Brand, Edward F Rosloniec, Linda K Myers, Arnold E Postlethwaite, Karen A Hasty, John M Stuart, Ae-Kyung Yi<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31809526">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Housekeeping gene validation for RT-qPCR studies on synovial fibroblasts derived from healthy and osteoarthritic patients with focus on mechanical loading.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Selection of appropriate housekeeping genes is essential for the validity of data normalization in reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Synovial fibroblasts (SF) play a mediating role in the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis, but there is no information on reliable housekeeping genes available. Therefore the goal of this study was to identify a set of reliable housekeeping genes suitable for studies of mechanical loading on SF from healthy and OA patients. Nine genes were evaluated towards expression stability and ranked according their relative stability determined by four different mathematical procedures (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and comparative ΔCq). We observed that RPLP0 (ribosomal protein, large, P0) and EEF1A1 (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1) turned out to be the genes with the most stable expression in SF from non-OA or OA patients treated with or without mechanical loading. According to geNorm two genes are sufficient for normalization throughout. Expression of one tested target gene varied considerably, if normalized to different candidate housekeeping genes. Our study provides a tool for accurate and valid housekeeping gene selection in gene expression experiments on SF from healthy and OA patients with and without mechanical loading in consistent with the MIQE (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments) guidelines and additionally demonstrates the impact of proper housekeeping gene selection on the expression of the gene of interest.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Ute Nazet, Agnes Schröder, Susanne Grässel, Dominique Muschter, Peter Proff, Christian Kirschneck<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31809510">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Skeletal muscle alterations in tachycardia-induced heart failure are linked to deficient natriuretic peptide signalling and are attenuated by RAS-/NEP-inhibition.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Heart failure induced cachexia is highly prevalent. Insights into disease progression are lacking.
METHODS: Early state of left ventricular dysfunction (ELVD) and symptomatic systolic heart failure (HF) were both induced in rabbits by tachypacing. Tissue of limb muscle (LM) was subjected to histologic assessment. For unbiased characterisation of early and late myopathy, a proteomic approach followed by computational pathway-analyses was performed and combined with pathway-focused gene expression analyses. Specimen of thoracic diaphragm (TD) served as control for inactivity-induced skeletal muscle alterations. In a subsequent study, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-system and neprilysin (RAS-/NEP) was compared to placebo.
RESULTS: HF was accompanied by loss of protein content (8.7±0.4% vs. 7.0±0.5%, mean±SEM, control vs. HF, p<0.01) and a slow-to-fast fibre type switch, establishing hallmarks of cachexia. In ELVD, the enzymatic set-up of LM and TD shifted to a catabolic state. A disturbed malate-aspartate shuttle went well with increased enzymes of glycolysis, forming the enzymatic basis for enforced anoxic energy regeneration. The histological findings and the pathway analysis of metabolic results drew the picture of suppressed PGC-1α signalling, linked to the natriuretic peptide system. In HF, natriuretic peptide signalling was desensitised, as confirmed by an increase in the ratio of serum BNP to tissue cGMP (57.0±18.6pg/ml/nM/ml vs. 165.8±16.76pg/ml/nM/ml, p<0.05) and a reduced expression of natriuretic peptide receptor-A. In HF, combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition prevented from loss in protein content (8.7±0.3% vs. 6.0±0.6% vs. 8.3±0.9%, Baseline vs. HF-Placebo vs. HF-RAS/NEP, p<0.05 Baseline vs. HF-Placebo, p = 0.7 Baseline vs. HF-RAS/NEP).
CONCLUSIONS: Tachypacing-induced heart failure entails a generalised myopathy, preceding systolic dysfunction. The characterisation of "pre-cachectic" state and its progression is feasible. Early enzymatic alterations of LM depict a catabolic state, rendering LM prone to futile substrate metabolism. A combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition ameliorates cardiac-induced myopathy independent of systolic function, which could be linked to stabilised natriuretic peptide/cGMP/PGC-1α signalling.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Dietl, Ingrid Winkel, Gabriela Pietrzyk, Michael Paulus, Astrid Bruckmann, Josef A Schröder, Samuel Sossalla, Andreas Luchner, Lars S Maier, Christoph Birner<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31800630">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Exosomes: A Novel Therapeutic Agent for Cartilage and Bone Tissue Regeneration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Despite traditionally treating autologous and allogeneic transplantation and emerging tissue engineering (TE)-based therapies, which have commonly performed in clinic for skeletal diseases, as the "gold standard" for care, undesirably low efficacy and other complications remain.

In particularly, chemotherapy and radiotherapy induced testicular damage, resulting in prolonged azoospermia. However, information regarding therapeutics to treat spermatogenesis disturbance after cancer treatment is scarce. Recently, we demonstrated that Goshajinkigan, a traditional Japanese medicine, can completely rescue severe busulfan-induced aspermatogenesis in mice. In this study, we aimed to detect the effects of Goshajinkigan on aspermatogenesis after irradiation.
METHODS: This is animal research about the effects of traditional Japanese medicine on infertility after cancer treatment. C57BL/6 J male mice received total body irradiation (TBI: a single dose of 6Gy) at 4 weeks of age and after 60 days were reared a Goshajinkigan (TJ107)-containing or TJ107-free control diet from day 60 to day 120. Then, two untreated females were mated with a single male from each experimental group. On day 60, 120 and 150, respectively, the sets of testes and epididymis of the mice in each group after deep anesthetization were removed for histological and cytological examinations.
RESULTS: Histological and histopathological data showed that 6Gy TBI treatment decreased the fertility rate (4/10) in the control diet group; in contrast, in the TJ107-diet group, the fertility rate was 10/10 (p < 0.05 vs. 6Gy group). Supplementation with TJ107 was found to rescue the disrupted inter-Sertoli tight junctions via the normalization of claudin11, occludin, and ZO-1 expression and reduce serum anti-germ cell autoantibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the therapeutic effect on TBI-induced aspermatogenesis and the recovering disrupted gonadal functions by supplementation with TJ107.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Kumpei Takahashi, Kenta Nagahori, Ning Qu, Miyuki Kuramasu, Yoshie Hirayanagi, Shogo Hayashi, Yuki Ogawa, Naoyuki Hatayama, Hayato Terayama, Kaori Suyama, Shuichi Hirai, Kou Sakabe, Masahiro Itoh<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Complement Altern Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1472-6882<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.61<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.754<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829240">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Withaferin A ameliorates ovarian cancer-induced cachexia and proinflammatory signaling.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths amongst women in the United States. Cachexia is the primary cause of death in approximately 30% of cancer patients, and is often evidenced in ovarian cancer patients. We tested the steroidal lactone Withaferin A to examine if it could ameliorate ovarian cancer-induced cachexia.
METHODS: Six-week-old severely immunodeficient female mice were xenografted with the ovarian cancer cell line A2780 followed by treatment with Withaferin A or vehicle. Changes in functional grip strength were assessed on a weekly basis. Postmortem, H&E staining was performed on skeletal muscle sections and immunofluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on skeletal muscle and tumor sections. The levels of NF-κB-related proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in the xenografted tumors and in resident host skeletal muscle.
RESULTS: Xenografting of the A2780 cell line resulted in a significant rate of mortality, which was attenuated by a therapeutic dosage of Withaferin A. Mice that received vehicle treatment following xenografting exhibited functional muscle decline over the course of the study. The therapeutic dosage Withaferin A treatment attenuated this reduction in grip strength, whereas the supratherapeutic dosage of Withaferin A was found to be toxic/lethal and demonstrated a further decline in functional muscle strength and an increased rate of mortality on par with vehicle treatment. At a histological level, the vehicle treated tumor-bearing mice exhibited a profound reduction in myofibrillar cross-sectional area compared to the vehicle treated tumor-free control group. The atrophic changes induced by the xenografted tumor were significantly ameliorated by treatment with Withaferin A. The combination of functional muscle weakening and induction of myofibrillar atrophy corroborate a cachectic phenotype, which was functionally rescued by Withaferin A. Further, treatment completely abolished the slow-to-fast myofiber type conversion observed in the settings of cancer-induced cachexia. In both host resident skeletal muscle and the xenografted tumors, we report an increase in NF-κB-related proinflammatory cytokines that was reversed by Withaferin A treatment. Finally, we demonstrated that Withaferin A significantly downregulates cytosolic and nuclear levels of phospho-p65, the active canonical NF-κB transcription factor, in xenografted tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulatively, our results demonstrate a previously overlooked role of Withaferin A in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. We propose mechanisms by which Withaferin A reduces NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production leading to an attenuation of the cachectic phenotype in an i.p. xenograft model of ovarian cancer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Alex R Straughn, Sham S Kakar<br><b>Journal:</b> J Ovarian Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-2215<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.54<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.938<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767036">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Abnormalities in the Motor Unit of a Fast-Twitch Lower Limb Skeletal Muscle in Huntington's Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Priscila Aparecida Costa Valadão, Bárbara Campos de Aragão, Jéssica Neves Andrade, Matheus Proença S Magalhães-Gomes, Giselle Foureaux, Julliane Vasconcelos Joviano-Santos, José Carlos Nogueira, Thatiane Cristina Gonçalves Machado, Itamar Couto Guedes de Jesus, Julia Meireles Nogueira, Rayan Silva de Paula, Luisa Peixoto, Fabíola Mara Ribeiro, Juan Carlos Tapia, ÉriKa Cristina Jorge, Silvia Guatimosim, Cristina Guatimosim<br><b>Journal:</b> ASN Neuro<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1759-0914<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.50<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.398<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818120">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Chitosans for Tissue Repair and Organ Three-Dimensional (3D) Bioprinting.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Chitosan is a unique natural resourced polysaccharide derived from chitin with special biocompatibility, biodegradability, and antimicrobial activity.

Topical application of a Chinese herbal paste for relieving OA knee pain can be effective and safe. However, evidence-based scientific research is insufficient to support its application worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo efficacy of a topical Chinese herbal paste on relieving OA knee pain and its underlying mechanism.
Methods: An OA rat model was developed by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) followed by treadmill running. A herbal paste including Dipsaci Radix, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Eucommiae Cortex and Psoraleae Fructus, named as DAEP, was applied topically on the knee joint of the rats (DAEP). The rats without DAEP treatment served as Control. Rats with surgery but without ACLT, treadmill running and DAEP treatment acted as Sham. The morphologic change of the knee joint was observed radiographically. Nociception from the knee of the rats was assessed using Incapacitent test and CatWalk gait system. The therapeutic mechanism was investigated by analyzing the gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers via qPCR and Western blot, respectively.
Results: Radiographic images showed less destruction at the posterior tibial plateau of the DAEP group compared with the Control after 2 weeks of treatment. The static weight ratio and the gait parameters of the Control were reduced significantly via Incapacitance test and CatWalk gait analysis, respectively. DAEP treatment increased the Print Area and Maximum Intensity significantly compared with the Control. DAEP significantly suppressed the upregulation of gene expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
Conclusions: DAEP exhibited its effect via the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of IκB kinase αβ (p-IKKαβ) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression.

Their pathogenesis is complex and involves many molecules including Myostatin (Mstn), which acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle. The characterisation of Mstn as a biomarker of malnutrition could be useful in the prevention and management of this condition. Previous studies have reported no conclusive results on the actual relationship between serum Mstn and wasting and malnutrition. So, in this study, we evaluated Mstn profile in a cohort of regular HD patients.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study, enrolling 37 patients undergoing bicarbonate-HD (BHD) or haemodiafiltration (HDF) at least for six months. 20 sex-matched healthy subjects comprised the control group. Mstn serum levels were evaluated by ELISA before and after HD. We collected clinical and biochemical data, evaluated insulin resistance, body composition, malnutrition [by Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS)] and tested muscle function (by hand-grip strength, six-minute walking test and a questionnaire on fatigue).
RESULTS: Mstn levels were not significantly different between HD patients and controls (4.7 ± 2.8 vs 4.5 ± 1.3 ng/ml). In addition, while a decrease in Mstn was observed after HD treatment, there were no differences between BHD and HDF. In whole group of HD patients Mstn was positively correlated with muscle mass (r = 0.82, p < 0.001) and inversely correlated with age (r = - 0.63, p < 0.01) and MIS (r = - 0.39, p = 0.01). No correlations were found between Mstn and insulin resistance, such as between Mstn levels and parameters of muscle strength and fatigue. In multivariate analysis, Mstn resulted inversely correlated with fat body content (β = - 1.055, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating Mstn is related to muscle mass and nutritional status in HD patients, suggesting that it may have a role in the regulation of skeletal muscle and metabolic processes. However, also considering the lack of difference of serum Mstn between healthy controls and HD patients and the absence of correlations with muscle function tests, our findings do not support the use of circulating Mstn as a biomarker of muscle wasting and malnutrition in HD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Pasquale Esposito, Yuri Battaglia, Edoardo La Porta, Maria Antonietta Grignano, Elena Caramella, Alessando Avella, Sabrina Peressini, Nicodemo Sessa, Riccardo Albertini, Giuseppe Di Natali, Claudio Lisi, Marilena Gregorini, Teresa Rampino<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Nephrol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2369<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.07<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.900<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829144">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> LncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 regulates miR-142-3p/HMGB1 to promote LPS-induced chondrocyte apoptosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 3 Associated Protein (MCM3AP) Antisense RNA 1 (MCM3AP-AS1) has been analyzed in liver cancer. But its role in osteoarthritis (OA) is unknown. Through bioinformatics analysis, we predicted that MCM3AP-AS1 may interact with miR-142-3p, which is a major player in OA. This study aimed to investigate the roles of MCM3AP-AS1 in OA and to explore its interactions with microRNA miR-142-3p.
METHODS: Differential expressions of MCM3AP-AS1 in OA patients and healthy participants were analyzed by performing quantitative PCR (qPCR). To analyze the relationship between MCM3AP-AS1 and miR-142-3p, human chondrocytes were transfected with MCM3AP-AS1 over-expression vector and miR-142-3p mimic. MCM3AP-AS1, miR-142-3p and high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) mRNA expression levels were measured by qPCR.
RESULTS: We found that MCM3AP-AS1 was up-regulated in OA. Bioinformatics analysis showed that MCM3AP-AS1 may interact with miR-142-3p, which can inhibit the apoptosis of chondrocytes. In addition, over-expression of MCM3AP-AS1 and miR-142-3p failed to affect the expression of each other. Instead, MCM3AP-AS1 over-expression led to up-regulated expressions of HMGB1, which is a target of miR-142-3p. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment led to the up-regulated expressions of MCM3AP-AS1 in chondrocytes. In cell apoptosis assay, MCM3AP-AS1 and HMGB1 over-expression led to increased apoptotic rate of chondrocytes. MiR-142-3p over-expression played an opposite role and attenuated the effects of MCM3AP-AS1 over-expression.

However, it is not well studied at the molecular level. The purpose of this study was to determine whether molecular and pathological changes in the meniscal tissue vary depending on the presence or absence of meniscal and/or anterior cruciate ligament tear (ACL).
METHODS: Six normal menisci (group A), seven simple torn menisci (group B) and seven torn menisci with concomitant anterior cruciate ligament tears (group C) were collected. We observed the pathological changes in the menisci and used real-time polymerase chain reaction along with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation to examine the levels of ACAN, ADAMTS5, COL10A1, CEBPβ, MMP13 and miR-381-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-193b-3p, miR-92a-3p, respectively. Patients were scored preoperatively and postoperatively using the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form.
RESULTS: Compared with group A, the expression levels of ADAMTS5, COL10A1, CEBPβ, and MMP13 and all the miRNAs were increased while ACAN was down-regulated in groups B and C. Additionally, the gene expression and miRNA levels were higher in group C than that in group B, except for ACAN, which was lower. Several fibrochondrocytes strongly expressed ADAMTS5, CEBPβ, and MMP13 in groups B and C and had high levels of miR-381-3p and miR-455-3p than that in group A. Postoperative Lysholm and IKDC scores were higher in group B than in group C.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the meniscus tended to degenerate after it was injured, especially when combined with a torn ACL. The miRNAs investigated in this study might also contribute to meniscus degeneration. Patients with a combined injury patterns might have relatively worse joint function.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Yi Long, Jingping Xie, Zhi-Qi Zhang, Ziji Zhang, Fangang Meng, Aishan He<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Musculoskelet Disord<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2474<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.05<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.880<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31787088">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> PI3K/Akt inhibitor partly decreases TNF-α-induced activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in osteoarthritis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The Cadherin-11 and PI3K/Akt pathway are increasingly recognized as the potential therapeutic target of osteoarthritis (OA) synovitis. The study aimed to investigate the role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the expression of Cadherin-11 and migration and invasive capacity of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) of OA patients under stimulation of TNF-α and to explore the effect of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor and Cadherin-11 antibody in the therapy of the collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA) mice.
METHODS: FLS were primarily cultured from synovium of osteoarthritic patients during total knee arthroplasty. Under the simulation of TNF-α, with or without PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002, Cadherin-11 expression was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot, as well as the migration and invasive capacity changes of OA FLS. Cadherin-11 antibody was injected intraarticularly or LY294002 was injected intraperitoneally in CIOA mice to evaluate the changes of synovitis score, cartilage damage, and Cadherin-11 expression.
RESULTS: TNF-α stimulation increased Cadherin-11 expression at mRNA and protein level in OA FLS and also increased the phosphorylation-dependent activation of Akt. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 attenuated TNF-α-induced overexpression of Cadherin-11 and decreased the invasive capacity of OA FLS. Intraperitoneal injection of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could decrease the Cadherin-11 protein expression in synovium of CIOA mice, although it has no significant inhibitory effect on synovitis and cartilage damage. Intraarticular injection of Cadherin-11 antibody attenuated the synovitis and cartilage damage in the CIOA joints and decreased Cadherin-11 expression in the synovial lining.
CONCLUSIONS: PI3K/Akt pathway was associated with TNF-α-induced activation of OA FLS, which may involve in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Anti-Cadherin-11 therapy in CIOA mice could attenuate the pathological changes of OA joints.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Songyang Liu, Chenxi Cao, Yujun Zhang, Guangyu Liu, Weixia Ren, Yanqi Ye, Tiezheng Sun<br><b>Journal:</b> J Orthop Surg Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1749-799X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.03<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.767<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829201">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nitric Oxide and Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate Signaling Mediates the Antidepressant Effects of Acupuncture in the Rat Model of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND Depression is a major mood disorder. Some patients have been reported to improve following acupuncture. This study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture on behaviors associated with depression in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model. The expression of signaling pathway components of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the rat hippocampus and plasma were also measured. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N=40) were divided into the control group (N=10), the model group (N=10), the acupuncture group (N=10), and the non-acupuncture group (N=10). The rat model was established by orphaning combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for six weeks. The acupuncture group was given 21 days of treatment using acupoints (AP) or non-acupoints (NP). Rat behaviors associated with depression were tested using the sucrose preference test (SPT), the open field test (OFT), and the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A, and NR2B in the rat plasma and hippocampus. RESULTS Acupuncture reversed the behaviors associated with depression in the CUMS rat model and reduced the expression of components of the NO and cGMP pathway in the rat hippocampus and plasma. CONCLUSIONS In the CUMS rat model, treatment with acupuncture reduced behaviors associated with depression, and these effects were associated with changes in the NO and cGMP signaling pathway.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Wenya Huang, Xianjun Meng, Yang Huang, Siyu Liu, Anning Zhu, Peng Li, Yu Wang, Bangyi Tang, Jiahua Shi, Yiqing Cai<br><b>Journal:</b> Med.

Here, we investigated the functional role of interleukin-26 (IL)-26 in osteoclastogenesis in RA.
METHODS: We analyzed levels of IL-20 receptor subunit A (IL-20RA), CD55, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) using confocal microscopy. Recombinant human IL-26-induced RANKL expression in RA-FLSs was examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and IL-26, after which osteoclastogenesis was evaluated by counting the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells. Additionally, osteoclastogenesis was evaluated by monocytes co-cultured with IL-26-prestimulated FLSs.
RESULTS: The expression of IL-20RA in RA-FLSs was higher than that in osteoarthritis-FLSs. Additionally, in IL-26-pretreated RA-FLSs, the expression of IL-20RA (but not IL-10 receptor subunit B) and RANKL increased in a dose-dependent manner, with IL-26-induced RANKL expression reduced by IL-20RA knockdown. Moreover, IL-26-induced RANKL expression was significantly downregulated by inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, IL-26 promoted osteoclast differentiation from peripheral blood monocytes in the presence of low dose of RANKL, with IL-26 exerting an additive effect. Furthermore, co-culture of IL-26-pretreated RA-FLSs with peripheral blood monocytes also increased osteoclast differentiation in the absence of addition of RANKL.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-26 regulated osteoclastogenesis in RA through increased RANKL expression in FLSs and direct stimulation of osteoclast differentiation. These results suggest the IL-26/IL-20RA/RANKL axis as a potential therapeutic target for addressing RA-related joint damage.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Kyung-Ann Lee, Kyoung-Woon Kim, Bo-Mi Kim, Ji-Yeon Won, Hong Ki Min, Dhong Won Lee, Hae-Rim Kim, Sang-Heon Lee<br><b>Journal:</b> Arthritis Res.

In the current study, we aimed to explore how long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (lncRNA XIST) function in collagen degradation in chondrocytes of osteoarthritis (OA) after tibial plateau fracture by regulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) promoter methylation.
METHODS: In silico analysis was used to screen differentially expressed lncRNAs in cartilage tissues of OA. Chondrocytes were then successfully isolated from normal and OA cartilage tissues and identified, with the expressions of lncRNA XIST and TIMP-3 examined. The methylation levels of TIMP-3 promoter were determined by MS-PCR. The binding of lncRNA XIST to DNA methyltransferase and the binding of TIMP-3 promoter to DNA methyltransferase were determined by a series of experiments, including RIP, RNA pull-down, and ChIP assays.
RESULTS: The differentially expressed lncRNA XIST was determined in OA. In addition, cartilage tissues of OA showed upregulation of lncRNA XIST and downregulation of TIMP-3. LncRNA XIST was primarily localized in the nucleus and was capable of binding to the promoter of TIMP-3. The silencing of lncRNA XIST decreased the methylation levels of TIMP-3 promoter and increased the expressions of TIMP-3, which consequently inhibited collagen degradation in OA chondrocytes. Furthermore, TIMP-3 over-expression reversed the effect of lncRNA XIST on collagen degradation in OA chondrocytes.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, lncRNA XIST raises collagen degradation in OA chondrocytes after tibial plateau fracture by accelerating the methylation of TIMP-3 promoter by recruiting DNA methyltransferase.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Chen, Shengdi Yang, Ruyi Shao<br><b>Journal:</b> Arthritis Res.

Our previous study demonstrated that programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), which is a tumour suppressor gene, is a target of microRNA‑21 (miR‑21), which affects the proliferation and transformation capabilities of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. However, the role of miR‑21 in the molecular mechanism underlying the migration, invasion and angiogenesis of RCC remains poorly understood. The effects of miR‑21 on the invasion, migration and angiogenesis of RCC cells was determined through meta‑analysis and regulation of miR‑21 expression in vitro. After searching several databases, 6 articles including a total of 473 patients met the eligibility criteria for this analysis. The combined results of the meta‑analysis revealed that increased miR‑21 expression was significantly associated with adverse prognosis in patients with RCC, with a pooled hazard ratio estimate of 1.740. In in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that a miR‑21 inhibitor decreased the number of migrating and invading A498 and 786‑O RCC cells, along with a decrease in PDCD4, c‑Jun, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9 expression. Additionally, inhibition of miR‑21 was revealed to reduce tube formation and tube junctions in the endothelial cell line HMEC‑1 by affecting the expression of angiotensin‑1 and vascular endothelial growth factor A, whereas PDCD4 small interfering RNA exerted opposite effects on the same cells. Overall, these findings, along with evidence‑based molecular biology, demonstrated that miR‑21 expression promoted the migration, invasion and angiogenic abilities of RCC cells by directly targeting the PDCD4/c‑Jun signalling pathway. The results may help elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the development and progression of RCC and provide a promising target for microRNA‑based therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Bo Fan, Yiying Jin, Hongshuo Zhang, Rui Zhao, Man Sun, Mengfan Sun, Xiaoying Yuan, Wei Wang, Xiaogang Wang, Zhiqi Chen, Wankai Liu, Na Yu, Qun Wang, Tingjiao Liu, Xiancheng Li<br><b>Journal:</b> Int.

We hypothesize that mesenchymal cells residing in IAATs may account for the specific inflammatory and metabolic patterns in OA patients.
METHODS: Adipocyte precursors (preadipocytes and dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATc)) from IAATs (infrapatellar and suprapatellar fat pads) and autologous subcutaneous adipose tissues (SCATs) were isolated from knee OA patients. The ability of these precursors to differentiate into adipocytes was assessed by oil red O staining after 14 days of culture in adipogenic medium. The gene expression of adipocyte-related transcription factors (C/EBP-α and PPAR-γ) and development-related factors (EN1 and SFRP2) were analyzed. The inflammatory pattern was assessed by RT-qPCR and ELISA (interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, Cox2, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE
RESULTS: IAAT preadipocytes displayed a significantly higher ability to differentiate into adipocytes and expressed significantly more C/EBP-α mRNA than SCAT preadipocytes. IAAT preadipocytes expressed significantly less EN-1 and SFRP2 mRNA than SCAT preadipocytes. Unstimulated IAAT preadipocytes displayed a less inflammatory pattern (IL-6, IL-8, and Cox2/PGE
CONCLUSION: IAAT adipocyte precursors from OA patients have a specific phenotype, which may account for the unique phenotype of OA IAATs.

Here, we examined the activity and roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the superficial zone (SFZ) of articular cartilage.
METHODS: Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity was analyzed using TOPGAL mice. We generated Prg4-Cre
RESULTS: Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity, as determined by the TOPGAL reporter, was high specifically in the SFZ of mouse adult articular cartilage, where Prg4 is abundantly expressed. In SFZ-specific β-catenin-knockout mice, OA development was significantly accelerated, which was accompanied by decreased Prg4 expression and SFZ destruction. In contrast, Prg4 expression was enhanced and cartilage degeneration was suppressed in SFZ-specific β-catenin-stabilized mice. In primary SFZ cells, Prg4 expression was downregulated by β-catenin knockout, while it was upregulated by β-catenin stabilization by exon 3 deletion or treatment with CHIR99021. Among Wnt ligands, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt9a were highly expressed in SFZ cells, and recombinant human WNT5A and WNT5B stimulated Prg4 expression. Mechanical loading upregulated expression of these ligands and further promoted Prg4 transcription. Moreover, mechanical loading and Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation increased mRNA levels of Creb1, a potent transcription factor for Prg4.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates Prg4 expression in the SFZ of mouse adult articular cartilage, which plays essential roles in the homeostasis of articular cartilage.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Fengjun Xuan, Fumiko Yano, Daisuke Mori, Ryota Chijimatsu, Yuji Maenohara, Hideki Nakamoto, Yoshifumi Mori, Yuma Makii, Takeshi Oichi, Makoto Mark Taketo, Hironori Hojo, Shinsuke Ohba, Ung-Il Chung, Sakae Tanaka, Taku Saito<br><b>Journal:</b> Arthritis Res.
