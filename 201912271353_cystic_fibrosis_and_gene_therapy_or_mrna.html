RESULTS: Here, we report on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that featured an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms of volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed. In a novel and major new development, computational predictions and assessment goals drove some of the experimental assays, resulting in new functional annotations for more than 1000 genes. Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation screening in Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes, which provided us with genome-wide experimental data for genes associated with biofilm formation and motility. We further performed targeted assays on selected genes in Drosophila melanogaster, which we suspected of being involved in long-term memory.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that while predictions of the molecular function and biological process annotations have slightly improved over time, those of the cellular component have not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations remains equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods is significantly better than the expectations set by baseline methods in C. albicans and D. melanogaster, it leaves considerable room and need for improvement. Finally, we report that the CAFA community now involves a broad range of participants with expertise in bioinformatics, biological experimentation, biocuration, and bio-ontologies, working together to improve functional annotation, computational function prediction, and our ability to manage big data in the era of large experimental screens.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Naihui Zhou, Yuxiang Jiang, Timothy R Bergquist, Alexandra J Lee, Balint Z Kacsoh, Alex W Crocker, Kimberley A Lewis, George Georghiou, Huy N Nguyen, Md Nafiz Hamid, Larry Davis, Tunca Dogan, Volkan Atalay, Ahmet S Rifaioglu, Alperen Dalkıran, Rengul Cetin Atalay, Chengxin Zhang, Rebecca L Hurto, Peter L Freddolino, Yang Zhang, Prajwal Bhat, Fran Supek, José M Fernández, Branislava Gemovic, Vladimir R Perovic, Radoslav S Davidović, Neven Sumonja, Nevena Veljkovic, Ehsaneddin Asgari, Mohammad R K Mofrad, Giuseppe Profiti, Castrense Savojardo, Pier Luigi Martelli, Rita Casadio, Florian Boecker, Heiko Schoof, Indika Kahanda, Natalie Thurlby, Alice C McHardy, Alexandre Renaux, Rabie Saidi, Julian Gough, Alex A Freitas, Magdalena Antczak, Fabio Fabris, Mark N Wass, Jie Hou, Jianlin Cheng, Zheng Wang, Alfonso E Romero, Alberto Paccanaro, Haixuan Yang, Tatyana Goldberg, Chenguang Zhao, Liisa Holm, Petri Törönen, Alan J Medlar, Elaine Zosa, Itamar Borukhov, Ilya Novikov, Angela Wilkins, Olivier Lichtarge, Po-Han Chi, Wei-Cheng Tseng, Michal Linial, Peter W Rose, Christophe Dessimoz, Vedrana Vidulin, Saso Dzeroski, Ian Sillitoe, Sayoni Das, Jonathan Gill Lees, David T Jones, Cen Wan, Domenico Cozzetto, Rui Fa, Mateo Torres, Alex Warwick Vesztrocy, Jose Manuel Rodriguez, Michael L Tress, Marco Frasca, Marco Notaro, Giuliano Grossi, Alessandro Petrini, Matteo Re, Giorgio Valentini, Marco Mesiti, Daniel B Roche, Jonas Reeb, David W Ritchie, Sabeur Aridhi, Seyed Ziaeddin Alborzi, Marie-Dominique Devignes, Da Chen Emily Koo, Richard Bonneau, Vladimir Gligorijević, Meet Barot, Hai Fang, Stefano Toppo, Enrico Lavezzo, Marco Falda, Michele Berselli, Silvio C E Tosatto, Marco Carraro, Damiano Piovesan, Hafeez Ur Rehman, Qizhong Mao, Shanshan Zhang, Slobodan Vucetic, Gage S Black, Dane Jo, Erica Suh, Jonathan B Dayton, Dallas J Larsen, Ashton R Omdahl, Liam J McGuffin, Danielle A Brackenridge, Patricia C Babbitt, Jeffrey M Yunes, Paolo Fontana, Feng Zhang, Shanfeng Zhu, Ronghui You, Zihan Zhang, Suyang Dai, Shuwei Yao, Weidong Tian, Renzhi Cao, Caleb Chandler, Miguel Amezola, Devon Johnson, Jia-Ming Chang, Wen-Hung Liao, Yi-Wei Liu, Stefano Pascarelli, Yotam Frank, Robert Hoehndorf, Maxat Kulmanov, Imane Boudellioua, Gianfranco Politano, Stefano Di Carlo, Alfredo Benso, Kai Hakala, Filip Ginter, Farrokh Mehryary, Suwisa Kaewphan, Jari Björne, Hans Moen, Martti E E Tolvanen, Tapio Salakoski, Daisuke Kihara, Aashish Jain, Tomislav Šmuc, Adrian Altenhoff, Asa Ben-Hur, Burkhard Rost, Steven E Brenner, Christine A Orengo, Constance J Jeffery, Giovanni Bosco, Deborah A Hogan, Maria J Martin, Claire O'Donovan, Sean D Mooney, Casey S Greene, Predrag Radivojac, Iddo Friedberg<br><b>Journal:</b> Genome Biol.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1474-760X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 12.16<br><b>SJR:</b> 9.867<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31744546">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Chemical-genetic profiling reveals limited cross-resistance between antimicrobial peptides with different modes of action.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are key effectors of the innate immune system and promising therapeutic agents. Yet, knowledge on how to design AMPs with minimal cross-resistance to human host-defense peptides remains limited. Here, we systematically assess the resistance determinants of Escherichia coli against 15 different AMPs using chemical-genetics and compare to the cross-resistance spectra of laboratory-evolved AMP-resistant strains. Although generalizations about AMP resistance are common in the literature, we find that AMPs with different physicochemical properties and cellular targets vary considerably in their resistance determinants. As a consequence, cross-resistance is prevalent only between AMPs with similar modes of action. Finally, our screen reveals several genes that shape susceptibility to membrane- and intracellular-targeting AMPs in an antagonistic manner. We anticipate that chemical-genetic approaches could inform future efforts to minimize cross-resistance between therapeutic and human host AMPs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Bálint Kintses, Pramod K Jangir, Gergely Fekete, Mónika Számel, Orsolya Méhi, Réka Spohn, Lejla Daruka, Ana Martins, Ali Hosseinnia, Alla Gagarinova, Sunyoung Kim, Sadhna Phanse, Bálint Csörgő, Ádám Györkei, Eszter Ari, Viktória Lázár, István Nagy, Mohan Babu, Csaba Pál, Balázs Papp<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31844052">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Extracellular matrix hydrogel derived from decellularized tissues enables endodermal organoid culture.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Organoids have extensive therapeutic potential and are increasingly opening up new avenues within regenerative medicine. However, their clinical application is greatly limited by the lack of effective GMP-compliant systems for organoid expansion in culture. Here, we envisage that the use of extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels derived from decellularized tissues (DT) can provide an environment capable of directing cell growth. These gels possess the biochemical signature of tissue-specific ECM and have the potential for clinical translation. Gels from decellularized porcine small intestine (SI) mucosa/submucosa enable formation and growth of endoderm-derived human organoids, such as gastric, hepatic, pancreatic, and SI. ECM gels can be used as a tool for direct human organoid derivation, for cell growth with a stable transcriptomic signature, and for in vivo organoid delivery. The development of these ECM-derived hydrogels opens up the potential for human organoids to be used clinically.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Giuseppe Giobbe, Claire Crowley, Camilla Luni, Sara Campinoti, Moustafa Khedr, Kai Kretzschmar, Martina Maria De Santis, Elisa Zambaiti, Federica Michielin, Laween Meran, Qianjiang Hu, Gijs van Son, Luca Urbani, Anna Manfredi, Monica Giomo, Simon Eaton, Davide Cacchiarelli, Vivian S W Li, Hans Clevers, Paola Bonfanti, Nicola Elvassore, Paolo De Coppi<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31827102">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Monkeys mutant for PKD1 recapitulate human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) caused by PKD1 mutations is one of the most common hereditary disorders. However, the key pathological processes underlying cyst development and exacerbation in pre-symptomatic stages remain unknown, because rodent models do not recapitulate critical disease phenotypes, including disease onset in heterozygotes. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generate ADPKD models with PKD1 mutations in cynomolgus monkeys. As in humans and mice, near-complete PKD1 depletion induces severe cyst formation mainly in collecting ducts. Importantly, unlike in mice, PKD1 heterozygote monkeys exhibit cyst formation perinatally in distal tubules, possibly reflecting the initial pathology in humans. Many monkeys in these models survive after cyst formation, and cysts progress with age. Furthermore, we succeed in generating selective heterozygous mutations using allele-specific targeting. We propose that our models elucidate the onset and progression of ADPKD, which will serve as a critical basis for establishing new therapeutic strategies, including drug treatments.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Tomoyuki Tsukiyama, Kenichi Kobayashi, Masataka Nakaya, Chizuru Iwatani, Yasunari Seita, Hideaki Tsuchiya, Jun Matsushita, Kahoru Kitajima, Ikuo Kawamoto, Takahiro Nakagawa, Koji Fukuda, Teppei Iwakiri, Hiroyuki Izumi, Iori Itagaki, Shinji Kume, Hiroshi Maegawa, Ryuichi Nishinakamura, Saori Nishio, Shinichiro Nakamura, Akihiro Kawauchi, Masatsugu Ema<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822676">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Proton channel blockers inhibit Duox activity independent of Hv1 effects.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The NADPH oxidase reaction produces protons.

Fortunately, cells have evolved several antioxidant defense mechanisms (as metabolites, vitamins, and enzymes) to neutralize or mitigate the harmful effect of reactive species and/or their byproducts. Any perturbation in the balance in the level of antioxidants and the reactive species results in a physiological condition called "oxidative stress." A catalase is one of the crucial antioxidant enzymes that mitigates oxidative stress to a considerable extent by destroying cellular hydrogen peroxide to produce water and oxygen. Deficiency or malfunction of catalase is postulated to be related to the pathogenesis of many age-associated degenerative diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, vitiligo, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, cancer, and schizophrenia. Therefore, efforts are being undertaken in many laboratories to explore its use as a potential drug for the treatment of such diseases. This paper describes the direct and indirect involvement of deficiency and/or modification of catalase in the pathogenesis of some important diseases such as diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vitiligo, and acatalasemia. Details on the efforts exploring the potential treatment of these diseases using a catalase as a protein therapeutic agent have also been described.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Ankita Nandi, Liang-Jun Yan, Chandan Kumar Jana, Nilanjana Das<br><b>Journal:</b> Oxid Med Cell Longev<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1942-0994<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.58<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.388<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31827713">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Overexpression of Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase in Allergic and Nonallergic Nasal Polyp.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sinonasal polyps are very common benign lesions of the nasal mucosa. Most of nasal polyps (NP) are idiopathic, and the pathophysiology of this disease is still incompletely understood. Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive molecule generated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO has been identified as an important mediator in airway function and pathogenesis of several respiratory system diseases. Histological and genetical expression of iNOS was detected to evaluate the role of NO in the pathogenesis of allergic (ANP) and nonallergic nasal polyps (NANP). Forty patients with nasal polyps (20 allergic and 20 nonallergic) were identified by history, clinical examination, and investigation. NPs were obtained from the middle turbinate (MT) during concha bullosa surgery. Twenty normal MT nasal tissues were taken as the control from patients undergoing concha bullosa surgery, without any evidence of allergy or inflammation. A nasal polyp specimen from each patient was subjected for immune-histochemical study followed by histological examination to detect the expression of iNOS. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the iNOS gene expression in isolated tissues. The expression of iNOS in both epithelial and stromal layers was greater in NP than in MT tissues. The ANP group showed more iNOS expression than those of the NANP group.

ERα-mediated signaling pathways are involved in proliferation of human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HiBECs) and portal inflammation. Our previous studies have shown that the expression levels of ERα in the liver tissues of PBC patients are positively correlated with the levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present study was designed to assess the relationship between abnormal ERα expression in small bile ducts and the progression of PBC. We examined the levels of multiple cytokines and analyzed their relationship with clinical parameters of livers functions in a cohort of 43 PBC patients and 45 healthy controls (HC).

However, since NETs can also damage endogenous cells, several control mechanisms for the formation of NETs must work effectively. For instance, neutrophil activation is silenced within blood circulation by the binding of sialylated glycoconjugates to sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) on neutrophils. As neutrophils are recruited within the female reproductive tract, after mating, a comparable mechanism may also take place within the bovine cervix to prevent an exaggerated NET formation and thus, infertility. We examined, if the highly glycosylated mucins, which are the major functional fraction of biomolecules in mucus, represent a potential regulator of NET formation. The qPCR data revealed that in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) inhibitory Siglecs are the most frequently expressed Siglecs and might be a potential target of sialylated glycans to modulate the activation of PMNs. Remarkably, the addition of bovine cervical mucins significantly inhibited the formation of NET, which had been induced in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or a combination of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. The inhibitory effects were independent of the stage of estrous cycle (estrus, luteal, and follicular mucins). PMNs retained their segmented nuclei and membrane perforation was prevented. However, the inhibitory effects were diminished, when sialic acids were released under acidic conditions. Comparable results were achieved, when sialic acids were targeted by neuraminidase digestion, indicating a sialic acid dependent inhibition of NET release. Thus, bovine cervical mucins have an anti-inflammatory capability to modulate NET formation and might be further immunomodulatory biomolecules that support fertility.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Kim F Bornhöfft, Alexander Rebl, Mary E Gallagher, Torsten Viergutz, Kristina Zlatina, Colm Reid, Sebastian P Galuska<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781090">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Reduced expression of miR-146a in human bronchial epithelial cells alters neutrophil migration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: The role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis and determining the phenotypes of asthma is not fully elucidated. miR-146a has been previously shown to suppress inflammatory responses in different cells. In this study, we investigated the functions of miR-146a in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in association with neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and paucigranulocytic phenotypes of asthma.
Methods: Bronchial brushing specimens and brochial mucosal biopsy samples were collected from adult patients with asthma and from age- and gender-matched non-asthmatic individuals. The expression of miR-146a in bronchial brushing specimens, bronchial biopsy tissue sections or cultured primary bronchial epithelial cells was analyzed by RT-qPCR or by in situ hybridization. The expression of direct and indirect miR-146a target genes was determined by RT-qPCR or ELISA. The migration of neutrophils was studied by neutrophil chemotaxis assay and flow cytometry. For statistical analysis, unpaired two-way Student's 
Results: Reduced expression of miR-146a was found in bronchial brushing specimens from asthma patients as compared to non-asthmatics and irrespective of the phenotype of asthma. In the same samples, the neutrophil attracting chemokines IL-8 and CXCL1 showed increased expression in patients with neutrophilic asthma and increased IL-33 expression was found in patients with eosinophilic asthma. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative association between the expression of miR-146a in bronchial brushings and neutrophil cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with asthma. In bronchial biopsy specimens, the level of miR-146a was highest in the epithelium as determined with in situ hybridization. In primary conventional HBEC culture, the expression of miR-146a was induced in response to the stimulation with IL-17A, TNF-α, and IL-4. The mRNA expression and secretion of IL-8 and CXCL1 was inhibited in both stimulated and unstimulated HBECs transfected with miR-146a mimics. Supernatants from HBECs transfected with miR-146a had reduced capability of supporting neutrophil migration in neutrophil chemotaxis assay.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that decreased level of miR-146a in HBECs from patients with asthma may contribute to the development of neutrophilic phenotype of asthma.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Anet Kivihall, Alar Aab, Jerzy Soja, Krzysztof Sładek, Marek Sanak, Alan Altraja, Bogdan Jakiela, Grazyna Bochenek, Ana Rebane<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin Transl Allergy<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-7022<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.27<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.369<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798831">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Therapeutic Prospects of mRNA-Based Gene Therapy for Glioblastoma.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The treatment of glioblastoma has been a big challenge for decades in the oncological field mainly owing to its unique biological characteristics, such as high heterogeneity, diffusing invasiveness, and capacity to resist conventional therapies.

The discovery that dedicated cellular genes control various aspects of this periodicity has led to studies of the molecular mechanism of the circadian response at the cellular level. It is now established that the circadian genes impact on a large network of hormonal, metabolic, and immunological pathways, affecting multiple aspects of biology. Recent studies have extended the role of the circadian system to the regulation of infection, host-pathogen interaction, and the resultant disease outcome. This critical review summarizes our current knowledge of circadian-pathogen interaction at both systemic and cellular levels, but with emphasis on the molecular aspects of the regulation.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent potential alternatives in the treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections. Here, we focus on Cecropins (Cecs), a group of naturally occurring AMPs in insects, and on synthetic Cec-analogs. We describe their action mechanisms and antimicrobial activity against MDR bacteria and other pathogens. We report several data suggesting that Cec and Cec-analog peptides are promising antibacterial therapeutic candidates, including their low toxicity against mammalian cells, and anti-inflammatory activity. We highlight limitations linked to the use of peptides as therapeutics and discuss methods overcoming these constraints, particularly regarding the introduction of nanotechnologies. New formulations based on natural Cecs would allow the development of drugs active against Gram-negative bacteria, and those based on Cec-analogs would give rise to therapeutics effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Cecs and Cec-analogs might be also employed to coat biomaterials for medical devices as an approach to prevent biomaterial-associated infections.

Sphingolipidoses (SP), which usually involve the loss of sphingolipid hydrolase function, are of lysosomal origin, and represent an important group of rare diseases among lysosomal storage disorders. Initial treatments consisted of enzyme replacement therapy, but, in recent decades, various therapeutic approaches have been developed. However, these commonly used treatments for SP fail to be fully effective and do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. New approaches, such as genome editing, have great potential for both the treatment and study of sphingolipidoses. Here, we review the most recent advances in the treatment and modelling of SP through the application of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. CRISPR-Cas9 is currently the most widely used method for genome editing. This technique is versatile; it can be used for altering the regulation of genes involved in sphingolipid degradation and synthesis pathways, interrogating gene function, generating knock out models, or knocking in mutations. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is being used as an approach to disease treatment, but more frequently it is utilized to create models of disease. New CRISPR-Cas9-based tools of gene editing with diminished off-targeting effects are evolving and seem to be more promising for the correction of individual mutations.

After transplacental transport, administered nucleic acids enter fetal circulation and are distributed among fetal tissues. TPGD was established in 1995 by Tsukamoto et al., and its mechanisms, and potential applications have been further characterized since. Recently, discoveries of sequence specific nucleases, such as zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) (CRISPR/Cas9), have revolutionized genome editing. In 2019, we demonstrated that intravenous injection of plasmid DNA containing CRISPR/Cas9 produced indels in fetal myocardial cells, which are comparatively amenable to transfection with exogenous DNA. In the future, this unique technique will allow manipulation of fetal cell functions in basic studies of fetal gene therapy.

Consequently, our ability to use ultrasound energy at a given intensity unlocks the opportunity to use the ultrasound for therapeutic applications. Indeed, in the last decade ultrasound-based therapies have emerged with promising treatment modalities for several medical conditions. More recently, ultrasound in combination with nanomedicines, i.e., nanoparticles, has been shown to have substantial potential to enhance the efficacy of many treatments including cancer, Alzheimer disease or osteoarthritis.

Intestinal organoids are a new reliable tool to investigate epithelial response in models of chronic inflammation. We produced organoids from the ulcerative colitis murine model Winnie to explore if the chronic inflammatory features observed in the parental intestine were preserved by the organoids. Furthermore, we investigated if quercetin administration to in vitro cultured organoids could suppress LPS-induced inflammation in wild-type organoids (WT-organoids) and spontaneous inflammation in ulcerative colitis organoids (UC-organoids). Our data demonstrate that small intestinal organoids obtained from Winnie mice retain the chronic intestinal inflammatory features characteristic of the parental tissue. Quercetin administration was able to suppress inflammation both in UC-organoids and in LPS-treated WT-organoids.

Subacromial bursa fibrosis is a prominent pathological feature of the shoulder disorder. MicroRNA-29a (miR-29a) regulates fibrosis in various tissues; however, the miR-29a action to subacromial bursa fibrosis remains elusive. Here, we reveal that subacromial synovium in patients with rotator cuff tear with shoulder stiffness showed severe fibrosis, hypertrophy, and hyperangiogenesis histopathology along with significant increases in fibrotic matrices collagen (COL) 1A1, 3A1, and 4A1 and inflammatory cytokines, whereas miR-29a expression was downregulated. Supraspinatus and infraspinatus tenotomy-injured shoulders in transgenic mice overexpressing miR-29a showed mild swelling, vascularization, fibrosis, and regular gait profiles as compared to severe rotator cuff damage in wild-type mice. Treatment with miR-29a precursor compromised COL3A1 production and hypervascularization in injured shoulders. In vitro, gain of miR-29a function attenuated COL3A1 expression through binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of COL3A1 in inflamed tenocytes, whereas silencing miR-29a increased the matrix expression. Taken together, miR-29a loss is correlated with subacromial bursa inflammation and fibrosis in rotator cuff tear with shoulder stiffness. miR-29a repressed subacromial bursa fibrosis through directly targeting COL3A1 mRNA, improving rotator cuff integrity and shoulder function.

Skeletal muscle has been identified as a direct target of thyroid hormone T3, where it regulates stem cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as myofiber metabolism. However, the effects of T3 in muscle-wasting conditions have not been yet addressed. Being T3 primarily responsible for the regulation of metabolism, we challenged mice with fasting and found that T3 counteracted starvation-induced muscle atrophy. Interestingly, T3 did not prevent the activation of the main catabolic pathways, i.e., the ubiquitin-proteasome or the autophagy-lysosomal systems, nor did it stimulate de novo muscle synthesis in starved muscles. Transcriptome analyses revealed that T3 mainly affected the metabolic processes in starved muscle. Further analyses of myofiber metabolism revealed that T3 prevented the starvation-mediated metabolic shift, thus preserving skeletal muscle mass.

Alterations in phospholipid metabolism may constitute a source of small molecule biomarkers for acute infections including CAP. Evidence from animal models of pulmonary infections and sepsis suggests that inhibiting acid sphingomyelinase (which releases ceramides from sphingomyelins) may reduce end-organ damage.
METHODS: We measured concentrations of 105 phospholipids, 40 acylcarnitines, and 4 ceramides, as well as acid sphingomyelinase activity, in plasma from patients with CAP (n = 29, sampled on admission and 4 subsequent time points), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with infection (COPD, n = 13) as a clinically important disease control, and 33 age- and sex-matched controls.
RESULTS: Phospholipid concentrations were greatly decreased in CAP and normalized along clinical improvement. Greatest changes were seen in phosphatidylcholines, followed by lysophosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and ceramides (three of which were upregulated), and were least in acylcarnitines. Changes in COPD were less pronounced, but also differed qualitatively, e.g. by increases in selected sphingomyelins. We identified highly accurate biomarkers for CAP (AUC ≤ 0.97) and COPD (AUC ≤ 0.93) vs. Controls, and moderately accurate biomarkers for CAP vs. COPD (AUC ≤ 0.83), all of which were phospholipids. Phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins were also markedly decreased in S. aureus-infected human A549 and differentiated THP1 cells. Correlations with C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were predominantly negative but only of mild-to-moderate extent, suggesting that these markers reflect more than merely inflammation. Consistent with the increased ceramide concentrations, increased acid sphingomyelinase activity accurately distinguished CAP (fold change = 2.8, AUC = 0.94) and COPD (1.75, 0.88) from Controls and normalized with clinical resolution.
CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the high potential of plasma phospholipids as biomarkers for CAP, begin to reveal differences in lipid dysregulation between CAP and infection-associated COPD exacerbation, and suggest that the decreases in plasma concentrations are at least partially determined by changes in host target cells. Furthermore, they provide validation in clinical blood samples of acid sphingomyelinase as a potential treatment target to improve clinical outcome of CAP.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Haroon Arshad, Juan Carlos López Alfonso, Raimo Franke, Katina Michaelis, Leonardo Araujo, Aamna Habib, Yuliya Zboromyrska, Eva Lücke, Emilia Strungaru, Manas K Akmatov, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Michael Meyer-Hermann, Astrid Petersmann, Matthias Nauck, Mark Brönstrup, Ursula Bilitewski, Laurent Abel, Jorg Sievers, Jordi Vila, Thomas Illig, Jens Schreiber, Frank Pessler<br><b>Journal:</b> J Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1479-5876<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.20<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.591<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31711507">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The E-Cadherin Cleavage Associated to Pathogenic Bacteria Infections Can Favor Bacterial Invasion and Transmigration, Dysregulation of the Immune Response and Cancer Induction in Humans.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Once bound to the epithelium, pathogenic bacteria have to cross epithelial barriers to invade their human host.

Apart from the repression of CAM genes, a drastic decrease in adhesion molecules on human epithelial cells can be obtained by induction of eukaryotic endoproteases named sheddases or through synthesis of their own (prokaryotic) sheddases. Cleavage of CAM by sheddases results in the release of soluble forms of CAM. The overexpression of soluble CAM in body fluids can trigger inflammation and pro-carcinogenic programming leading to tumor induction and metastasis. In addition, the reduction of the surface expression of E-cad on epithelia could be accompanied by an alteration of the anti-bacterial and anti-tumoral immune responses. This immune response dysfunction is likely to occur through the deregulation of immune cells homing, which is controlled at the level of E-cad interaction by surface molecules α<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Christian A Devaux, Soraya Mezouar, Jean-Louis Mege<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Microbiol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-302X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.19<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.633<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781079">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Jatrorrhizine Balances the Gut Microbiota and Reverses Learning and Memory Deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental components and has become a major public health issue throughout the world. Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the evolution of those major pathological symptoms. Jatrorrhizine (JAT), a main component of a traditional Chinese herbal, coptidis rhizome, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and we previously showed that it is also able to clear oxygen free radicals and reduce inflammatory responses. In this study, we demonstrated that JAT administration could alleviate the learning and memory deficits in AD. Furthermore, we also found that JAT treatment reduced the levels of Aβ plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. Other studies suggest that there are gut microbiome alterations in AD. In order to explore the underlying mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD, DNA sequencing for 16s rDNA V3-V4 was performed in fecal samples from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice. Our results indicated that APP/PS1 mice showed less Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) abundance in gut microbiota than WT mice and with different composition. Furthermore, JAT treatment enriched OTUs abundance and alpha diversity in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT mice. High dose of JAT treatment altered the abundance of some specific gut microbiota such as the most predominant phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, APP/PS1 mice display gut dysbiosis, and JAT treatment not only improved the memory deficits, but also regulated the abundance of the microbiota. This may provide a therapeutic way to balance the gut dysbiosis in AD patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Wang, Wei Jiang, Ting Ouyang, Xiu-Yin Shen, Fen Wang, Yu-Hua Qu, Min Zhang, Tao Luo, Hua-Qiao Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862965">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Bronchial epithelium repair by Esculentin-1a-derived antimicrobial peptides: involvement of metalloproteinase-9 and interleukin-8, and evaluation of peptides' immunogenicity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The airway epithelium is seriously damaged upon pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers.

Airway epithelial cells express FOXO3a and play an important role in clearing rhinovirus (RV) by mounting antiviral type I and type III interferon (IFN) responses. To elucidate the role of FOXO3a in regulating antiviral responses, we generated airway epithelial cell-specific Foxo3a knockout (Scga1b1-Foxo3a-/-) mice and a stable FOXO3a knockout human airway epithelial cell line. Compared to wild-type, Scga1b1-Foxo3a-/- mice show reduced IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-λ2/3 in response to challenge with RV or double-stranded (ds)RNA mimic, Poly Inosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) indicating defective dsRNA receptor signaling. RV-infected Scga1b1-Foxo3a-/- mice also show viral persistence, enhanced lung inflammation and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. FOXO3a K/O airway epithelial cells show attenuated IFN responses to RV infection and this was associated with conformational change in mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) but not with a reduction in the expression of dsRNA receptors under unstimulated conditions. Pretreatment with MitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial-specific antioxidant corrects MAVS conformation and restores antiviral IFN responses to subsequent RV infection in FOXO3a K/O cells. Inhibition of oxidative stress also reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to RV in FOXO3a K/O cells. Together, our results indicate that FOXO3a plays a critical role in regulating antiviral responses as well as limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Based on these results, we conclude that FOXO3a contributes to optimal viral clearance and prevents excessive lung inflammation following RV infection.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Joao Gimenes-Junior, Nicole Owuar, Hymavathi Reddy Vari, Wuyan Li, Nathaniel Xander, Sudhir Kotnala, Uma S Sajjan<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31796819">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Altered generation of ciliated cells in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In COPD, epithelial changes are prominent features in the airways, such as goblet cell hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia.

We hypothesized that bronchial epithelial cell lineage specification is dysregulated in COPD because of an aberrant reprogramming through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Surgical lung tissue from 81 COPD and 61 control (smokers and non-smokers) patients was assessed for bronchial epithelial cell phenotyping by immunohistochemistry, both in situ and in vitro in reconstituted air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures.

We analyzed the global gene expression in epithelium collected intraoperatively from subjects undergoing photorefractive keratectomy. Subjects were grouped into those that developed haze 12 months post surgery (n = 6 eyes; haze predisposed) and those that did not develop haze in a similar follow up duration (n = 11 eyes; controls). Ontological analysis of 1100 upregulated and 1780 downregulated genes in the haze predisposed group revealed alterations in pathways associated with inflammation, wnt signaling, oxidative stress, nerve functions and extra cellular matrix remodeling. Novel factors such as PREX1, WNT3A, SOX17, GABRA1and PXDN were found to be significantly altered in haze predisposed subjects and those with active haze(n = 3), indicating their pro-fibrotic role.

In Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), an accelerated loss and dysfunction of endothelial cells leads to progressively severe visual impairment. An abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) is a distinctive hallmark of the disease, however the molecular pathogenic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Here, we investigate genome-wide and sequence-specific DNA methylation changes of miRNA genes in corneal endothelial samples from FECD patients. We discover that miRNA gene promoters are frequent targets of aberrant DNA methylation in FECD. More specifically, miR-199B is extensively hypermethylated and its mature transcript miR-199b-5p was previously found to be almost completely silenced in FECD. Furthermore, we find that miR-199b-5p directly and negatively regulates Snai1 and ZEB1, two zinc finger transcription factors that lead to increased ECM deposition in FECD. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of matrix protein production by corneal endothelial cells in which miR-199B hypermethylation leads to miR-199b-5p downregulation and thereby the increased expression of its target genes, including Snai1 and ZEB1.

Recently, it was suggested that macrophages contribute to impaired host defence and excessive inflammatory responses in CF. Indeed, dysfunction attributed to CF macrophages includes decreased bacterial killing and exaggerated inflammatory responses. However, the mechanisms behind such defects have only been partially defined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of several macrophage functions, including their activation, differentiation and polarisation. The goal of this study was to investigate whether miRNA dysregulation underlies the functional abnormalities of CF macrophages. MiRNA profiling of macrophages was performed, with 22 miRNAs identified as differentially expressed between CF and non-CF individuals. Among these, miR-146a was associated with significant enrichment of validated target genes involved in responses to microorganisms and inflammation. As miR-146a dysregulation has been reported in several human inflammatory diseases, we analysed the impact of increased miR-146a expression on inflammatory responses of CF macrophages. These data show that inhibition of miR-146a in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated CF macrophages results in increased interleukin-6 production, which suggests that miR-146a overexpression in CF is functional, to restrict inflammatory responses.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Francesco R Luly, Manuella Lévêque, Valerio Licursi, Giuseppe Cimino, Corinne Martin-Chouly, Nathalie Théret, Rodolfo Negri, Luca Cavinato, Fiorentina Ascenzioni, Paola Del Porto<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31700158">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Detection, identification, and quantification of oxidative protein modifications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Exposure of biological molecules to oxidants is inevitable and therefore commonplace.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) is a key transcription factor that regulates adipogenesis. CEBPA has been shown to be essential for lung maturation, and deficiency of CEBPA expression leads to abnormal lung architecture. However, its specific role in lung fibroblast regulation and fibrosis has not yet been elucidated.
METHODS: Lung fibroblast CEBPA expression, pro-fibrotic and lipofibroblast gene expression were assessed by qRT-PCR. CEBPA gain and loss of function experiments were carried out to evaluate the role of CEBPA in human lung fibroblast activation with and without TGF-β1 treatment. Adipogenesis assay was used to measure the adiopogenic potential of lung fibroblasts. Finally, CRISPR activation system was used to enhance endogenous CEBPA expression.
RESULTS: We found that CEBPA gene expression is significantly decreased in IPF-derived fibroblasts compared to normal lung fibroblasts. CEBPA knockdown in normal human lung fibroblasts enhanced fibroblast pro-fibrotic activation and ECM production. CEBPA over-expression by transient transfection in IPF-derived fibroblasts significantly reduced pro-fibrotic gene expression, ECM deposition and αSMA expression and promoted the formation of lipid droplets measured by Oil Red O staining and increased lipofibroblast gene expression. Inhibition of the histone methyl transferase G9a enhanced CEBPA expression, and the anti-fibrotic effects of G9a inhibition were partially mediated by CEBPA expression. Finally, targeted CRISPR-mediated activation of CEBPA resulted in fibroblasts switching from fibrogenic to lipofibroblast states.
CONCLUSIONS: CEBPA expression is reduced in human IPF fibroblasts and its deficiency reduces adipogenic potential and promotes fibrogenic activation. CEBPA expression can be rescued via an inhibitor of epigenetic repression or by targeted CRISPR activation, leading to reduced fibrogenic activation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Jeffrey A Meridew, Aja Aravamudhan, Giovanni Ligresti, Daniel J Tschumperlin, Qi Tan<br><b>Journal:</b> Respir.

The pathological mechanism causing pulmonary fibrosis remains unknown. Emerging evidence suggests prominent roles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in myofibroblast formation and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Our previous work has demonstrated the regulation of YY1 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and pathogenesis of fibroid lung. However, the specific function of YY1 in AECs during the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis is yet to be determined. Herein, we found the higher level of YY1 in primary fibroblasts than that in primary epithelial cells from the lung of mouse. A549 and BEAS-2B cells, serving as models for type II alveolar pulmonary epithelium in vitro, were used to determine the function of YY1 during EMT of AECs. TGF-β-induced activation of the pro-fibrotic program was applied to determine the role YY1 may play in pro-fibrogenesis of type II alveolar epithelial cells. Upregulation of YY1 was associated with EMT and pro-fibrotic phenotype induced by TGF-β treatment. Targeted knockdown of YY1 abrogated the EMT induction by TGF-β treatment. Enforced expression of YY1 can partly mimic the TGF-β-induced pro-fibrotic change in either A549 cell line or primary alveolar epithelial cells, indicating the induction of YY1 expression may mediate the TGF-β-induced EMT and pro-fibrosis. In addition, the translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was demonstrated in A549 cells after TGF-β treatment and/or YY1 overexpression, suggesting that NF-κB-YY1 signaling pathway regulates pulmonary fibrotic progression in lung epithelial cells. These findings will shed light on the better understanding of mechanisms regulating pro-fibrogenesis in AECs and pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Chuyi Zhang, Xiaoping Zhu, Yifei Hua, Qian Zhao, Kaijing Wang, Lixiao Zhen, Guangxue Wang, Jinhui Lü, An Luo, William C Cho, Xin Lin, Zuoren Yu<br><b>Journal:</b> Respir.

Here, due to differences in cognate tRNA abundance, synonymous codons are translated at different speeds, and slow codons then stimulate mRNA decay. To ask if this phenomenon also occurs in humans, we isolated RNA stability effects due to coding regions using the human ORFeome collection. We find that many open reading frame (ORF) characteristics, such as length and secondary structure, fail to provide explanations for how coding regions alter mRNA stability, and, instead, that the ORF relies on translation to impact mRNA stability. Consistent with what has been seen in other organisms, codon use is related to the effects of ORFs on transcript stability.

In the last decade great advances have been made in studying and manipulating metabolic programs in immune cells. Immunometabolism has primarily focused on glycolysis, the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as well as free fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. These pathways are important for providing the energy needs of cell growth, membrane rigidity, cytokine production and proliferation. In this review, we will however, highlight the specific role of iron metabolism at the cellular and organismal level, as well as how the bioavailability of this metal orchestrates complex metabolic programs in immune cell homeostasis and inflammation. We will also discuss how dysregulation of iron metabolism contributes to alterations in the immune system and how these novel insights into iron regulation can be targeted to metabolically manipulate immune cell function under pathophysiological conditions, providing new therapeutic opportunities for autoimmunity and cancer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Shane J F Cronin, Clifford J Woolf, Guenter Weiss, Josef M Penninger<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Mol Biosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2296-889X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.59<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.787<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31824960">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genetic deletion of Sphk2 confers protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated differential expression of genes related to virulent infection and inflammation in mouse lung.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious life threatening and nosocomial infections including pneumonia.

The processes in the uterine endometrium in response to conceptus signaling are complex. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize transcriptome changes in porcine endometrium during the time of conceptus attachment considering the specific localization in different endometrial cell types.
RESULTS: Low-input RNA-sequencing was conducted for the main endometrial compartments, luminal epithelium (LE), glandular epithelium (GE), blood vessels (BV), and stroma. Samples were isolated from endometria collected on Day 14 of pregnancy and the estrous cycle (each group n = 4) by laser capture microdissection. The expression of 12,000, 11,903, 11,094, and 11,933 genes was detectable in LE, GE, BV, and stroma, respectively. Differential expression analysis was performed between the pregnant and cyclic group for each cell type as well as for a corresponding dataset for complete endometrium tissue samples. The highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was found for LE (1410) compared to GE, BV, and stroma (800, 1216, and 384). For the complete tissue, 3262 DEGs were obtained. The DEGs were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) terms to find overrepresented functional categories and pathways specific for the individual endometrial compartments. GO classification revealed that DEGs in LE were involved in 'biosynthetic processes', 'related to ion transport', and 'apoptotic processes', whereas 'cell migration', 'cell growth', 'signaling', and 'metabolic/biosynthetic processes' categories were enriched for GE. For blood vessels, categories such as 'focal adhesion', 'actin cytoskeleton', 'cell junction', 'cell differentiation and development' were found as overrepresented, while for stromal samples, most DEGs were assigned to 'extracellular matrix', 'gap junction', and 'ER to Golgi vesicles'.
CONCLUSIONS: The localization of differential gene expression to different endometrial cell types provided a significantly improved view on the regulation of biological processes involved in conceptus implantation, such as the control of uterine fluid secretion, trophoblast attachment, growth regulation by Wnt signaling and other signaling pathways, as well as the modulation of the maternal immune system.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Shuqin Zeng, Susanne E Ulbrich, Stefan Bauersachs<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Genomics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2164<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.829<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752681">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Editorial focus: understanding off-target effects as the key to successful RNAi therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> With the first RNA interference (RNAi) drug (ONPATTRO (patisiran)) on the market, we witness the RNAi therapy field reaching a critical turning point, when further improvements in drug candidate design and delivery pipelines should enable fast delivery of novel life changing treatments to patients.

Objective: To identify the roles of PA colonization in bronchiectasis by exploring for sputum exosomal microRNA profiles.
Methods: We enrolled 98 patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis and 17 healthy subjects. Sputum was split for bacterial culture and exosomal microRNA sequencing, followed by validation with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Bronchiectasis patients were stratified into PA and non-PA colonization groups based on sputum culture findings. We applied Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway enrichment analysis to explore biological pathways corresponding to the differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) associated with PA colonization.
Results: Eighty-two bronchiectasis patients and 9 healthy subjects yielded sufficient sputum that passed quality control. We identified 10 overlap DEMs for the comparison between bronchiectasis patients and healthy subjects, and between PA and non-PA colonization group. Both miR-92b-5p and miR-223-3p could discriminate PA colonization (C-statistic >0.60) and independently correlated with PA colonization in multiple linear regression analysis.

ECM protects wound tissue from infection and additional injury, and is gradually degraded during wound healing. For some unknown reasons, myofibroblasts (the cells that secrete ECM) do not undergo apoptosis; this is associated with the continuous secretion of ECM and reduced ECM degradation even during de novo tissue formation. Thus, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are considered to be a potential target of fibrosis treatment because they are the main groups of ECM-degrading enzymes. However, MMPs participate not only in ECM degradation but also in the development of various biological processes that show the potential to treat diseases such as stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and arthritis. Therefore, treatment involving the targeting of MMPs might impede typical functions. Here, we evaluated the links between these MMP functions and possible detrimental effects of fibrosis treatment, and also considered possible approaches for further applications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Hong-Meng Chuang, Yu-Shuan Chen, Horng-Jyh Harn<br><b>Journal:</b> Molecules<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1420-3049<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.01<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.757<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752262">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The novel aminoglycoside, ELX-02, permits CTNSW138X translational read-through and restores lysosomal cystine efflux in cystinosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Cystinosis is a rare disorder caused by recessive mutations of the CTNS gene. Current therapy decreases cystine accumulation, thus slowing organ deterioration without reversing renal Fanconi syndrome or preventing eventual need for a kidney transplant.15-20% of cystinosis patients harbour at least one nonsense mutation in CTNS, leading to premature end of translation of the transcript. Aminoglycosides have been shown to permit translational read-through but have high toxicity level, especially in the kidney and inner ear. ELX-02, a modified aminoglycoside, retains it read-through ability without the toxicity.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We ascertained the toxicity of ELX-02 in cells and in mice as well as the effect of ELX-02 on translational read-through of nonsense mutations in cystinotic mice and human cells. ELX-02 was not toxic in vitro or in vivo, and permitted read-through of nonsense mutations in cystinotic mice and human cells.
CONCLUSIONS: ELX-02 has translational read-through activity and produces a functional CTNS protein, as evidenced by reduced cystine accumulation. This reduction is comparable to cysteamine treatment.

We compared several measures of innate antibacterial immune function across seven different ungulate species using blood samples obtained from captive animals maintained in a zoological park. We measured mRNA expression of two receptors involved in innate pathogen detection, toll-like receptors 2 and 5 (TLR2 and 5), the bactericidal capacity of plasma, as well as the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Species examined included aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), American bison (Bison bison bison), yak (Bos grunniens), Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti), fallow deer (Dama dama), sika deer (Cervus nippon), and Damara zebra (Equus quagga burchellii). Innate immunity varied among ungulate species. However, we detected strong, positive correlations between the different measures of innate immunity-specifically, TLR2 and TLR5 were correlated, and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was positively associated with TLR2, TLR5, and bacterial killing ability. Our results suggest that ecoimmunological study results may be quite robust to the choice of assays, at least for antibacterial innate immunity; and that, despite the complexity of the immune system, important sources of variation in immunity in natural populations may be discoverable with comparatively simple tools.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Brian S Dugovich, Lucie L Crane, Benji B Alcantar, Brianna R Beechler, Brian P Dolan, Anna E Jolles<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31774834">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Clinical utility of combined preimplantation genetic testing methods in couples at risk of passing on beta thalassemia/hemoglobin E disease: A retrospective review from a single center.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Thalassemia and hemoglobinopathy is a group of hereditary blood disorder with diverse clinical manifestation inherited by autosomal recessive manner. The Beta thalassemia/Hemoglobin E disease (HbE/βthal) causes a variable degree of hemolysis and the most severe form of HbE/βthal disease develop a lifelong transfusion-dependent anemia. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is an established procedure of embryo genetic analysis to avoid the risk of passing on this particular condition from the carrier parents to their offspring. Preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy (PGT-A) also facilitates the selection of embryos without chromosomal aberration resulting in the successful embryo implantation rate. Herein, we study the clinical outcome of using combined PGT-M and PGT-A in couples at risk of passing on HbE/βthal disease. The study was performed from January 2016 to December 2017. PGT-M was developed using short tandem repeat linkage analysis around the beta globin gene cluster and direct mutation testing using primer extension-based mini-sequencing. Thereafter, we recruited 15 couples at risk of passing on HbE/βthal disease who underwent a combined total of 22 IVF cycles. PGT was performed in 106 embryos with a 3.89% allele drop-out rate. Using combined PGT-M and PGT-A methods, 80% of women obtained satisfactory genetic testing results and were able to undergo embryo transfer within the first two cycles. The successful implantation rate was 64.29%. PGT accuracy was evaluated by prenatal and postnatal genetic confirmation and 100% had a genetic status consistent with PGT results. The overall clinical outcome of successful live birth for couples at risk of producing offspring with HbE/βthal was 53.33%.

In domestic pigs, acute infection by highly virulent ASF viruses causes hemorrhagic fever and death. Previous work has suggested that ASFV pathogenesis is primarily mediated by host cytokines produced by infected monocytes and macrophages. To better understand molecular mechanisms mediating virus pathogenesis and immune evasion, we used transcriptome analysis to identify gene expression changes after ASFV infection in ex vivo swine macrophages. Our results suggest that the cytokines of TNF family including FASLG, LTA, LTB, TNF, TNFSF4, TNFSF10, TNFSF13B and TNFSF18 are the major causative cytokine factors in ASF pathogenesis via inducing apoptosis. Other up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines (IL17F and interferons) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL10) may also significantly contribute to ASF pathogenesis and cause excessive tissue inflammatory responses. The differential expression of genes also indicates that ASFV could evade both the innate and adaptive immune responses by (i) inhibiting MHC Class II antigen processing and presentation, (ii) avoiding CD8+ T effector cells and neutrophil extracellular traps via decreasing expression of neutrophil/CD8+ T effector cell-recruiting chemokines, (iii) suppressing M1 activation of macrophages, (iv) inducing immune suppressive cytokines, and (v) inhibiting the processes of macrophage autophagy and apoptosis. These results provide novel information to further investigate and better understand the mechanism of pathogenesis and immune evasion of this devastating swine disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-14<br><b>Authors:</b> James J Zhu, Palaniappan Ramanathan, Elizabeth A Bishop, Vivian O'Donnell, Douglas P Gladue, Manuel V Borca<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31725732">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Equine bronchial fibroblasts enhance proliferation and differentiation of primary equine bronchial epithelial cells co-cultured under air-liquid interface.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Interaction between epithelial cells and fibroblasts play a key role in wound repair and remodelling in the asthmatic airway epithelium. We present the establishment of a co-culture model using primary equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBECs) and equine bronchial fibroblasts (EBFs). EBFs at passage between 4 and 8 were seeded on the bottom of 24-well plates and treated with mitomycin C at 80% confluency. Then, freshly isolated (P0) or passaged (P1) EBECs were seeded on the upper surface of membrane inserts that had been placed inside the EBF-containing well plates and grown first under liquid-liquid interface (LLI) then under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions to induce epithelial differentiation. Morphological, structural and functional markers were monitored in co-cultured P0 and P1 EBEC monolayers by phase-contrast microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, hematoxylin-eosin, immunocytochemistry as well as by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transepithelial transport of selected drugs. After about 15-20 days of co-culture at ALI, P0 and P1 EBEC monolayers showed pseudo-stratified architecture, presence of ciliated cells, typically honeycomb-like pattern of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) expression, and intact selective barrier functions. Interestingly, some notable differences were observed in the behaviour of co-cultured EBECs (adhesion to culture support, growth rate, differentiation rate) as compared to our previously described EBEC mono-culture system, suggesting that cross-talk between epithelial cells and fibroblasts actually takes place in our current co-culture setup through paracrine signalling.

Biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa exhibit much greater resistance to antibiotics than the planktonic form of the bacteria. Few groups have studied the effects of glucose, a major carbon source, and metabolite, on P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and on its metabolic pathways. In this study, we investigated the effect of glucose on the biofilm formation ability of P. aeruginosa and carried out a metabolomic analysis to identify whether glucose alters the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa in biofilms. We found that glucose efficiently promoted P. aeruginosa biofilm formation by upregulating the expression of the extracellular polysaccharide-related gene pslA. Treatment with glucose caused an increase in 7 metabolites (including 3-hydroxypropionic acid, glucose-6-phosphate, and 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid) and a decrease in 18 metabolites (including myo-inositol, glutamine, and methoxamedrine) in the biofilm. In addition, there was a synergistic effect between glucose and horse serum on biofilm formation when the two were added in combination, which also increased the resistance of biofilm to levofloxacin therapy. Thus, our work sheds light on the underlying mechanisms by which glucose may enhance biofilm formation and identifies novel targets for developing strategies to counteract biofilm formation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei She, Yanle Wang, Yiqing Liu, Fang Tan, Lihua Chen, Zhen Luo, Yong Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> Microbiologyopen<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-8827<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.113<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532581">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Is selecting better than modifying? An investigation of arguments against germline gene editing as compared to preimplantation genetic diagnosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Recent scientific advances in the field of gene editing have led to a renewed discussion on the moral acceptability of human germline modifications. Gene editing methods can be used on human embryos and gametes in order to change DNA sequences that are associated with diseases. Modifying the human germline, however, is currently illegal in many countries but has been suggested as a 'last resort' option in some reports. In contrast, preimplantation genetic (PGD) diagnosis is now a well-established practice within reproductive medicine. Both methods can be used to prevent children from being born with severe genetic diseases.
MAIN TEXT: This paper focuses on four moral concerns raised in the debate about germline gene editing (GGE) and applies them to the practice of PGD for comparison: Violation of human dignity, disrespect of the autonomy and the physical integrity of the future child, discrimination of people living with a disability and the fear of slippery slope towards immoral usage of the technology, e.g. designing children for specific third party interests. Our analysis did not reveal any fundamental differences with regard to the four concerns.
CONCLUSION: We argue that with regard to the four arguments analyzed in this paper germline gene editing should be considered morally (at least) as acceptable as the selection of genomes on the basis of PGD. However, we also argue that any application of GGE in reproductive medicine should be put on hold until thorough and comprehensive laws have been implemented to prevent the abuse of GGE for non-medical enhancement.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Alix Lenia V Hammerstein, Matthias Eggel, Nikola Biller-Andorno<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Med Ethics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1472-6939<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.085<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752935">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Determining the pathogenicity of CFTR missense variants: Multiple comparisons of in silico predictors and variant annotation databases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Pathogenic variants in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene (CFTR) are responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), the commonest monogenic autosomal recessive disease, and CFTR-related disorders in infants and youth. Diagnosis of such diseases relies on clinical, functional, and molecular studies. To date, over 2,000 variants have been described on CFTR (~40% missense). Since few of them have confirmed pathogenicity, in silico analysis could help molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling. Here, the pathogenicity of 779 CFTR missense variants was predicted by consensus predictor PredictSNP and compared to annotations on CFTR2 and ClinVar. Sensitivity and specificity analysis was divided into modeling and validation phases using just variants annotated on CFTR2 and/or ClinVar that were not in the validation datasets of the analyzed predictors. After validation phase, MAPP and PhDSNP achieved maximum specificity but low sensitivity. Otherwise, SNAP had maximum sensitivity but null specificity. PredictSNP, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, nsSNPAnalyzer had either low sensitivity or specificity, or both. Results showed that most predictors were not reliable when analyzing CFTR missense variants, ratifying the importance of clinical information when asserting the pathogenicity of CFTR missense variants. Our results should contribute to clarify decision making when classifying the pathogenicity of CFTR missense variants.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Marcus Michels, Ursula Matte, Lucas Rosa Fraga, Aline Castello Branco Mancuso, Rodrigo Ligabue-Braun, Elias Figueroa Rodrigues Berneira, Marina Siebert, Maria Teresa Vieira Sanseverino<br><b>Journal:</b> Genet.

Transcriptomic studies of severe equine asthma (SEA) showed downregulation of the gene encoding SALSA in bronchial epithelium of asthmatic compared to non-asthmatic horses. This study aimed to characterize expression of SALSA in equine tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC), corroborate potential differences in epithelial gene expression between asthmatic and non-asthmatic horses, and assess the structure of equine SALSA. An antibody against SALSA was validated through immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and Western blotting to recognize the equine protein. This antibody was applied to tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 22 tissues each from four horses. A quantitative PCR assay was designed to compare gene expression for SALSA between six asthmatic and six non-asthmatic horses, before and after an asthmatic challenge, using cDNA from endoscopic bronchial biopsies as source material.

DESIGN: We enrolled 49 prepubertal patients (24 males and 25 females) affected by CF in a stable clinical condition, 19 of whom had been diagnosed through newborn screening and 30 following presentation of symptoms. Patients had no significant comorbidity affecting growth or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-related diabetes requiring insulin therapy. Blood was collected during two follow-up visits to measure insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), growth hormone-binding protein (GHBP), and GHR gene expression. Recruited as a control group were 52 healthy children, sex- and age-matched, were recruited as a control group.
METHODS: We compared body mass index (BMI), height, weight, IGF-I, GHBP, and GHR gene expression values (evaluated by Chemiluminescent Immunometric assay; ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively) in CF patients diagnosed through newborn screening (NBS) or by symptoms (late diagnosis [LD]) and in healthy controls.
RESULTS: BMI increased significantly in patients between the time of diagnosis and check-up (
CONCLUSION: In our LD patients during childhood, we observed good auxological values and a GH/IGF-I axis function within normal range for the factor evaluated. However, earlier diagnosis through NBS might further minimize and prevent growth retardation, by reducing the duration of symptoms before treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Sara Pagani, Elena Bozzola, Gloria Acquafredda, Vito Terlizzi, Valeria Raia, Fabio Majo, Alberto Villani, Mauro Bozzola<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin Med Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1554-6179<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.79<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.609<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462537">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy-Related Disease-Causing Genes and Norrin/<br><b>Abstract:</b> Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a hereditary ocular disorder characterized by incomplete vascularization/abnormality of peripheral retina.

In mammalian blastocysts, in which the first embryonic lumen forms, many studies have investigated how the cell lineages are specified through genetics and signaling, whereas potential roles of the fluid lumen have yet to be investigated. We discover that in mouse pre-implantation embryos at the onset of lumen formation, cytoplasmic vesicles are secreted into intercellular space. The segregation of epiblast and primitive endoderm directly follows lumen coalescence. Notably, pharmacological and biophysical perturbation of lumen expansion impairs the specification and spatial segregation of primitive endoderm cells within the blastocyst. Luminal deposition of FGF4 expedites fate specification and partially rescues the reduced specification in blastocysts with smaller cavities. Combined, our results suggest that blastocyst lumen expansion plays a critical role in guiding cell fate specification and positioning, possibly mediated by luminally deposited FGF4. Lumen expansion may provide a general mechanism for tissue pattern formation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Allyson Quinn Ryan, Chii Jou Chan, François Graner, Takashi Hiiragi<br><b>Journal:</b> Dev.

The most abundant source to isolate MSCs is adipose tissue. Currently, perirenal adipose tissue is rarely described as the source of MSCs. MSCs were isolated from perirenal adipose tissue (prASCs) from patients undergoing tumor nephrectomies, cultured and characterized by flow cytometry and their differentiation potential into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and epithelial cells. Furthermore, prASCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or a mixture of cytokines (cytomix). In addition, prASC susceptibility to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was investigated. The expression of inflammatory readouts was estimated by qPCR and immunoassay. HCMV infection was analyzed by qPCR and immunostaining. Characterization of cultured prASCs shows the cells meet the criteria of MSCs and prASCs can undergo trilineage differentiation. Cultured prASCs can be induced to differentiate into epithelial cells, shown by cytokeratin 18 expression. Stimulation of prASCs with LPS or cytomix suggests the cells are capable of initiating an inflammation-like response upon stimulation with LPS or cytokines, whereas, LTA did not induce a significant effect on the readouts (ICAM-1, IL-6, TNFα, MCP-1 mRNA and IL-6 protein). HCMV broadly infects prASCs, showing a viral load dependent cytopathological effect (CPE). Our current study summarizes the isolation and culture of prASCs, clearly characterizes the cells, and demonstrates their immunomodulatory potential and high permissiveness for HCMV.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Patrick C Baer, Benjamin Koch, Elena Hickmann, Ralf Schubert, Jindrich Cinatl, Ingeborg A Hauser, Helmut Geiger<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671899">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> 75th Congress of the Italian Society of Pediatrics : Bologna, Italy. 29 May - 1 June 2019.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> <br><b>Journal:</b> Ital J Pediatr<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1824-7288<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849329">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> AAV-mediated gene therapy targeting TRPV4 mechanotransduction for inhibition of pulmonary vascular leakage.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Enhanced vascular permeability in the lungs can lead to pulmonary edema, impaired gas exchange, and ultimately respiratory failure. While oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilation, and pressure-reducing medications help alleviate these symptoms, they do not treat the underlying disease. Mechanical activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channels contributes to the development of pulmonary vascular disease, and overexpression of the high homology (HH) domain of the TRPV4-associated transmembrane protein CD98 has been shown to inhibit this pathway. Here, we describe the development of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the CD98 HH domain in which the AAV serotypes and promoters have been optimized for efficient and specific delivery to pulmonary cells. AAV-mediated gene delivery of the CD98 HH domain inhibited TRPV4 mechanotransduction in a specific manner and protected against pulmonary vascular leakage in a human lung Alveolus-on-a-Chip model. As AAV has been used clinically to deliver other gene therapies, these data raise the possibility of using this type of targeted approach to develop mechanotherapeutics that target the TRPV4 pathway for treatment of pulmonary edema in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Juan Li, Amy M Wen, Ratnakar Potla, Ezekiel Benshirim, Ariel Seebarran, Maximilian A Benz, Olivier Y F Henry, Benjamin D Matthews, Rachelle Prantil-Baun, Sarah E Gilpin, Oren Levy, Donald E Ingber<br><b>Journal:</b> APL Bioeng<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-2877<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803860">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Microphysiological systems modeling acute respiratory distress syndrome that capture mechanical force-induced injury-inflammation-repair.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Complex <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Viola, Jonathan Chang, Jocelyn R Grunwell, Louise Hecker, Rabindra Tirouvanziam, James B Grotberg, Shuichi Takayama<br><b>Journal:</b> APL Bioeng<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-2877<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768486">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> TMEM16A chloride channel does not drive mucus production.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Airway mucus obstruction is the main cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by mutations in the CFTR Cl<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Filipa B Simões, Margarida C Quaresma, Luka A Clarke, Iris Al Silva, Ines Pankonien, Violeta Railean, Arthur Kmit, Margarida D Amaral<br><b>Journal:</b> Life Sci Alliance<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2575-1077<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31732694">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hypoxic mast cells accelerate the proliferation, collagen accumulation and phenotypic alteration of human lung fibroblasts.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Pulmonary vascular remodeling and fibrosis are the critical pathological characteristics of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Our previous study demonstrated that hypoxia is involved in the functional alteration of lung fibroblasts, but the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of mast cells on the proliferation, function and phenotype of fibroblasts under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia facilitated proliferation and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑6, in human mast cells (HMC‑1). RNA sequencing identified 2,077 upregulated and 2,418 downregulated mRNAs in human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL‑1) cultured in hypoxic conditioned medium from HMC‑1 cells compared with normoxic controls, which are involved in various pathways, including extracellular matrix organization, cell proliferation and migration. Conditioned medium from hypoxic HMC‑1 cells increased the proliferation and migration capacity of HFL‑1 and triggered phenotypic transition from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. A greater accumulation of collagen type I and III was also observed in an HFL‑1 cell culture in hypoxic conditioned medium from HMC‑1 cells, compared with HFL‑1 cells cultured in normoxic control medium. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑9 and MMP‑13 was upregulated in HFL‑1 cells grown in hypoxic conditioned medium from HMC‑1 cells. Similar pathological phenomena, including accumulation of mast cells, activated collagen metabolism and vascular remodeling, were observed in a hypoxic rat model. The results of the present study provide direct evidence that the multiple effects of the hypoxic microenvironment and mast cells on fibroblasts contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling, and this process appears to be among the most important mechanisms underlying hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Wang, Lianjun Lin, Xiaoyu Chai, Yanping Wu, Yong Li, Xinmin Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Int.
