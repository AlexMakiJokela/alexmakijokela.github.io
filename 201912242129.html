Corticosteroids have been a cornerstone for treating PV, but because of side effects the treatment is combined with other conventional immune modulating drugs and rituximab. The Danish treatment protocol for pemphigus vulgaris is similar to the other Scandinavian countries, and therefore this study is of importance for clinicians in the Scandinavian countries as well as other European countries. We retrospectively identified all patients with Pemphigus vulgaris in our tertiary center over a 7-year period in order to register patient characteristics, treatment, adverse events, comorbidities and the effect of prednisolone dose on remission. In this study 19 patients met the inclusion criteria and remission was seen after a mean of 19.9 weeks, and relapse was seen in 50% after the mean time of 15 weeks. Time to relapse in our study is relatively short compared to studies in which rituximab is used as a first-line drug in treating pemphigus vulgaris.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31850351">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Education moderates the effects of large central artery aging on cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Central artery aging, including elevated aortic stiffness, central blood pressure (BP), and pulse pressure (PP), is a novel risk factor for the development of age-associated cognitive dysfunction. Individuals with higher educational attainment may develop greater brain pathology prior to the onset of cognitive decline. However, whether education moderates relations between central artery aging and cognitive performance is unknown. We hypothesized that years of formal education would moderate the relation between central artery aging and cognitive performance in middle-aged/older (MA/O) adults (n = 113, age 67.3 ± 0.7 years). Significant interactions between education*central systolic BP (β = .21, p = .02) and education*central PP (β = .22, p = .01) demonstrated weaker associations between central BP and PP with processing speed performance in those with higher education. Similarly, education moderated the relation between aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, cfPWV) and executive function performance (β = .21, p = .02). To test if the relation between central arterial aging and cognitive performance was captured by a predetermined education threshold, MA/O adults were secondarily categorized as ≤high school (HS) (i.e., ≤12 years, n = 36) or >HS (≥13 years, n = 77). Higher central systolic BP was associated with slower processing speed (≤HS: r = -.59, p < .001 vs. >HS: r = -.25, p = .03) and weaker executive function (r = -.39, p = .03 vs. r = -.32, p = .006). Higher cfPWV was selectively correlated with weaker executive function performance (r = -.39, p = .03) in ≤HS only and this association significantly differed between education groups. Educational attainment appears to moderate the adverse effects of central artery aging on cognitive performance among MA/O adults.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31833225">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MELAS in a Walk-in Customer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831998">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Anti-Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Effects of Barberry (<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31827685">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Left Atrial Myxoma Presenting as Lateral Medullary (Wallenberg's) Syndrome.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Myxomas are benign, primary tumors of the heart.

Findings of an inpatient survey.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who use emergency medical services (EMS) receive quicker reperfusion treatment which, in turn, mitigates post-stroke disability. However, nationally only 59% use EMS. We examined why AIS patients use or do not use EMS.
METHODS: During 2016-2018, a convenience sample of AIS patients admitted to a primary stroke center in South Carolina were surveyed during hospitalization if they were medically fit, available for survey when contacted, and consented to participate. The survey was programed into EpiInfo with skip patterns to minimize survey burden and self-administered on a touchscreen computer. Survey questions covered symptom characteristics, knowledge of stroke and EMS importance, subjective reactions, role of bystanders and financial factors. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Of 108 inpatients surveyed (out of 1179 AIS admissions), 49% were male, 44% African American, mean age 63.5 years, 59% mild strokes, 75 (69%) arrived by EMS, 33% were unaware of any stroke symptom prior to stroke, and 75% were unaware of the importance of EMS use for good outcome. Significant factors that influenced EMS use decisions (identified by regression analysis adjusting for stroke severity) were: prior familiarity with stroke (self or family/friend with stroke) adjusted odds ratio, 5.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6, 15.1), perceiving symptoms as relevant for self and indicating possible stroke, 26.3 (7.6, 91.1), and bystander discouragement to call 911, 0.1 (0.01,0.7). Further, all 27 patients who knew the importance of EMS had used EMS. All patients whose physician office advised actions other than calling EMS at symptom onset, did not use EMS.
CONCLUSION: Systematic stroke education of patients with stroke-relevant comorbidities and life-style risk factors, and public health educational programs may increase EMS use and mitigate post-stroke disability.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31796059">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> REGAIN STUDY: Retrospective Study to Assess the Effectiveness, Tolerability, and Safety of Ferric Carboxymaltose in the Management of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Pregnant Women.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) during pregnancy arises because of preexisting inadequate stores or complex physiological changes and can lead to serious maternal and fetal complications. Oral iron, either as iron sulfate or fumarate, with or without folic acid, is the most commonly used treatment for IDA in pregnancy. Intravenous (IV) iron has a role in the treatment of IDA in pregnancy, particularly in women who present late, display severe anemia (Hb ≤ 9 g/dL), or risk factors, and are intolerant/noncompliant of oral iron. Previously, administration of IV iron was minimal, owing to potentially serious anaphylactic reactions. Recently, new IV iron products have been developed, offering better compliance, tolerability, efficacy, and a good safety profile. Our study aimed to assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in the treatment of IDA in pregnant women in the UAE. Data from 1001 pregnant women who received at least one administration of FCM (500, 1000, or 1500 mg) during their second or third trimester of pregnancy (2 years backward from study initiation) were collected retrospectively from electronic medical records at Corniche Hospital, Abu Dhabi, UAE. Results showed that 41.4% of the women were able to achieve an increase of ≥2 g/dL in blood hemoglobin overall. A change of ≥2 g/dL was achieved by 27.5% of women administered a dose of 500 mg, 39.2% of women administered a dose of 1000 mg, and 63.9% of women administered a dose of 1500 mg of IV FCM. This indicates a directly proportional relationship between increasing IV FCM dose and the increase of ≥2 g/dL in blood hemoglobin. A total of 7 (0.7%) women reported mild, nonserious adverse events during the study. Within the limits of this retrospective study, IV FCM therapy was safe and effective in increasing the mean hemoglobin of pregnant women with IDA.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781389">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cytoprotective Effects of Dinitrosyl Iron Complexes on Viability of Human Fibroblasts and Cardiomyocytes.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that plays a key role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) generating NO are widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the involvement of DNICs in the metabolic processes of the cell, their protective properties in doxorubicin-induced toxicity remain to be clarified. Here, we found that novel class of mononuclear DNICs with functional sulfur-containing ligands enhanced the cell viability of human lung fibroblasts and rat cardiomyocytes. Moreover, DNICs demonstrated remarkable protection against doxorubicin-induced toxicity in fibroblasts and in rat cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells). Data revealed that the DNICs compounds modulate the mitochondria function by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31780929">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Preclinical update on regulation of intracranial pressure in relation to idiopathic intracranial hypertension.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is observed in association with a range of brain disorders. One of these challenging disorders is idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), characterized by raised ICP of unknown cause with significant morbidity and limited therapeutic options. In this review, special focus is put on the preclinical research performed in order to understand the pathophysiology behind ICP regulation and IIH. This includes cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, molecular mechanisms underlying disturbances in brain fluids leading to elevated ICP, role of obesity in IIH, development of an IIH model and ICP measurements in rodents. The review also discusses existing and new drug targets for IIH that have been evaluated in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: ICP monitoring in rodents is challenging and different methods have been applied. Some of these methods are invasive, depend on use of anesthesia and only allow short-term monitoring. Long-term ICP recordings are needed to study IIH but existing methods are hampered by several limitations. As obesity is one of the most common risk factors for IIH, a rodent obese model has been developed that mimics some key aspects of IIH. The most commonly used drugs for IIH have been evaluated in vivo for their efficacy at lowering ICP in the existing animal models. These studies suggest these drugs, including acetazolamide, might have limited or no reducing effect on ICP. Two drug targets that can impact ICP in healthy rodents are topiramate and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist. However, it remains to evaluate their effect in an IIH model with more precise and valid ICP monitoring system. Therefore, continued evaluation in the preclinical research with refined tools is of great importance to further understand the pathophysiology behind disorders with raised ICP and to explore new drug targets.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767019">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Multidisciplinary management of a large pheochromocytoma presenting with cardiogenic shock: a case report.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytoma is well-known for sudden initial presentations, particularly in younger patients. Hemodynamic instability may cause serious complications and delay a patient's ability to undergo surgical resection. Larger tumors present a further challenge because of the risk of catecholamine release during manipulations. In the case we present, increases in systemic vascular resistance caused cardiogenic shock, and the size of the lesion prompted surgeons to veer off from their usual approach.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old female patient was admitted to our intensive care unit with hypertension and later cardiogenic shock. Profound systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.12) was noted together with severely increased systemic vascular resistance, and gradually responded to vasodilator infusion. A left-sided 11-cm adrenal mass was found with computed tomography and confirmed a pheochromocytoma with a meta-iodo-benzyl-guanidine scintigraphy. Surgical treatment was carefully planned by the endocrinologist, anesthesiologist and surgeon, and was ultimately successful. After prolonged hemodynamic stabilization, open adrenalectomy and nephrectomy were deemed safer because of lesion size and the apparent invasion of the kidney. Surgery was successful and the patient was discharged home 5 days after surgery. She is free from disease at almost 2 years from the initial event.
CONCLUSIONS: Large, invasive pheochromocytoma can be safely and effectively managed with open resection in experienced hands, provided all efforts are made to achieve hemodynamic stabilization and to minimize. Catecholamine release before and during surgery.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-21<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31747934">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Commentary: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy-Acute Cardiac Dysfunction Associated With Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31736867">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Identifying and addressing gaps in the implementation of a community care team for care of Patients with multiple chronic conditions.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple chronic conditions represent a growing segment for healthcare. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) supports leveraging community programs to support patients and their caregivers overwhelmed by their treatment plans, but this component has lagged behind the adoption of other model elements. Community Care Teams (CCTs) leverage partnerships between healthcare delivery systems and existing community programs to address this deficiency. There remains a gap in moving CCTs from pilot phase to sustainable full-scale programs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the cognitive and structural needs of clinicians, social workers, and nurse care coordinators to effectively refer appropriate patients to the CCT and the value these stakeholders derived from referring to and receiving feedback from the CCT. We then sought to translate this knowledge into an implementation toolkit to bridge implementation gaps.
METHODS: Our research process was guided by the Assess, Innovate, Develop, Engage, and Devolve (AIDED) implementation science framework. During the Assess process we conducted chart reviews, interviews, and observations and in Innovate and Develop phases, we worked with stakeholders to develop an implementation toolkit. The Engage and Devolve phases disseminate the toolkit through social networks of clinical champions and are ongoing.
RESULTS: We completed 14 chart reviews, 11 interviews, and 2 observations. From these, facilitators and barriers to CCT referrals and patient re-integration into primary care were identified. These insights informed the development of a toolkit with seven components to address implementation gaps identified by the researchers and stakeholders.
CONCLUSION: We identified implementation gaps to sustaining the CCT program, a community-healthcare partnership, and used this information to build an implementation toolkit. We established liaisons with clinical champions to diffuse this information. The AIDED Model, not previously used in high-income countries' primary care settings, proved adaptable and useful.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-15<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31730457">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pharmacy-based predictors of non-adherence, non-persistence and reinitiation of antihypertensive drugs among patients on oral diabetes drugs in the Netherlands.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Adherence to antihypertensive drugs in patients with diabetes is important. To support adherence, attention should be paid to the dynamic process of implementation, persistence and reinitiation of these drugs. We assessed non-adherence, non-persistence and reinitiation patterns for antihypertensive drugs in patients on oral diabetes drugs and identified pharmacy-based predictors of these processes.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in patients on oral diabetes drugs who initiated antihypertensive drugs between 1995-2015, as registered in the IADB.nl pharmacy database. Non-adherence was defined as a medication possession ratio < 80% and non-persistence as a gap > 180 days. We defined reinitiation as the dispensing of an antihypertensive drug within one year following discontinuation. We provide descriptive statistics for different time periods and applied logistic and Cox regressions to assess associations with sociodemographic and drug-related factors.
RESULTS: Of 6,669 initiators, non-adherence rates in persistent patients decreased from 11.0% in the first year to 8.5% and 7.7% in the second and third years, respectively. Non-persistence rates decreased from 18.0% in the first year to 3.7% and 2.9% in the second and third years, respectively. Of the 1,201 patients who discontinued in the first year, 22.0% reinitiated treatment within one year. Non-adherence and non-persistence rates were lower in the more recent time period. Predictors of non-adherence were secondary prevention (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.10-1.93) and diuretics as initial drug class (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.08-1.74). Predictors of non-persistence were female gender (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.05-1.32), older age (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08-1.63) and diuretics, beta-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers as initial drug class. Longer duration of persistence was a predictor of reinitiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to antihypertensive drugs in patients on oral diabetes drugs has improved over time. The first year after initiation is the most crucial with regard to non-adherence and non-persistence, and the risk groups are different for both processes. Early non-persistence is a risk factor for not reinitiating treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-15<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31730627">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Global Outcome Assessment Life-long after stroke in young adults initiative-the GOAL initiative: study protocol and rationale of a multicentre retrospective individual patient data meta-analysis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, 2 million patients aged 18-50 years suffer a stroke each year, and this number is increasing. Knowledge about global distribution of risk factors and aetiologies, and information about prognosis and optimal secondary prevention in young stroke patients are limited. This limits evidence-based treatment and hampers the provision of appropriate information regarding the causes of stroke, risk factors and prognosis of young stroke patients.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Global Outcome Assessment Life-long after stroke in young adults (GOAL) initiative aims to perform a global individual patient data meta-analysis with existing data from young stroke cohorts worldwide. All patients aged 18-50 years with ischaemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage will be included. Outcomes will be the distribution of stroke aetiology and (vascular) risk factors, functional outcome after stroke, risk of recurrent vascular events and death and finally the use of secondary prevention. Subgroup analyses will be made based on age, gender, aetiology, ethnicity and climate of residence.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the GOAL study has already been obtained from the Medical Review Ethics Committee region Arnhem-Nijmegen. Additionally and when necessary, approval will also be obtained from national or local institutional review boards in the participating centres. When needed, a standardised data transfer agreement will be provided for participating centres. We plan dissemination of our results in peer-reviewed international scientific journals and through conference presentations. We expect that the results of this unique study will lead to better understanding of worldwide differences in risk factors, causes and outcome of young stroke patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-15<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31727655">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Longitudinal assessment of utilities in patients with migraine: an analysis of erenumab randomized controlled trials.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses in patients with migraine require estimates of patients' utility values and how these relate to monthly migraine days (MMDs). This analysis examined four different modelling approaches to assess utility values as a function of MMDs.
METHODS: Disease-specific patient-reported outcomes from three erenumab clinical studies (two in episodic migraine [NCT02456740 and NCT02483585] and one in chronic migraine [NCT02066415]) were mapped to the 5-dimension EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) as a function of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6™) using published algorithms. The mapped utility values were used to estimate generic, preference-based utility values suitable for use in economic models. Four models were assessed to explain utility values as a function of MMDs: a linear mixed effects model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML), a fractional response model with logit link, a fractional response model with probit link and a beta regression model.
RESULTS: All models tested showed very similar fittings. Root mean squared errors were similar in the four models assessed (0.115, 0.114, 0.114 and 0.114, for the linear mixed effect model with REML, fractional response model with logit link, fractional response model with probit link and beta regression model respectively), when mapped from MSQ. Mean absolute errors for the four models tested were also similar when mapped from MSQ (0.085, 0.086, 0.085 and 0.085) and HIT-6 and (0.087, 0.088, 0.088 and 0.089) for the linear mixed effect model with REML, fractional response model with logit link, fractional response model with probit link and beta regression model, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis describes the assessment of longitudinal approaches in modelling utility values and the four models proposed fitted the observed data well. Mapped utility values for patients treated with erenumab were generally higher than those for individuals treated with placebo with equivalent number of MMDs. Linking patient utility values to MMDs allows utility estimates for different levels of MMD to be predicted, for use in economic evaluations of preventive therapies.

This case-control study assessed stroke subtypes by age and the role of comorbidities in women with dysmenorrhea.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data obtained between 1997 and 2013 from Taiwan's health insurance database identified 514 stroke cases and 31,201 non-stroke controls in women with dysmenorrhea aged 15-49 years. Proportional distributions of subtypes and odds ratios (ORs) of stroke associated with comorbidities by age and subtype were measured. We found that the stroke risk in dysmenorrheal patients increased with age, and that hypertension was nine-fold more prevalent in the stroke cases than in the controls and was associated with an adjusted OR of 4.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.46-5.92) for all stroke cases. Moreover, the proportion of hemorrhagic stroke was greater than that of ischemic stroke in younger dysmenorrheal patients between 15-24 years old (50.5% vs. 11.4%), whereas this was reversed in those aged 30-49 years old (16.1% vs. 21.0%). Overall, 25.3% of the stroke cases consisted of transient cerebral ischemia and 31.3% were other acute but ill-defined cerebrovascular diseases, in which the prevalence increased with age for both types of strokes. Hypertension was the comorbidity with the highest OR associated with each subtype stroke; diabetes, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, and thyroid disease were also comorbidities that were significantly associated with ill-defined cerebrovascular diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The stroke type varies by age in dysmenorrheal patients, and hypertension is the most important comorbidity associated with all types of stroke; therefore, more attention for stroke prevention must be paid to women with dysmenorrhea, particularly when combined with comorbidities.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31714928">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Representation of people with comorbidity and multimorbidity in clinical trials of novel drug therapies: an individual-level participant data analysis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Clinicians are less likely to prescribe guideline-recommended treatments to people with multimorbidity than to people with a single condition. Doubts as to the applicability of clinical trials of drug treatments (the gold standard for evidence-based medicine) when people have co-existing diseases (comorbidity) may underlie this apparent reluctance. Therefore, for a range of index conditions, we measured the comorbidity among participants in clinical trials of novel drug therapies and compared this to the comorbidity among patients in the community.
METHODS: Data from industry-sponsored phase 3/4 multicentre trials of novel drug therapies for chronic medical conditions were identified from two repositories: Clinical Study Data Request and the Yale University Open Data Access project. We identified 116 trials (n = 122,969 participants) for 22 index conditions. Community patients were identified from a nationally representative sample of 2.3 million patients in Wales, UK. Twenty-one comorbidities were identified from medication use based on pre-specified definitions. We assessed the prevalence of each comorbidity and the total number of comorbidities (level of multimorbidity), for each trial and in community patients.
RESULTS: In the trials, the commonest comorbidities in order of declining prevalence were chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, affective disorders, acid-related disorders, asthma/COPD and diabetes. These conditions were also common in community-based patients. Mean comorbidity count for trial participants was approximately half that seen in community-based patients. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of trial participants had a high degree of multimorbidity. For example, in asthma and psoriasis trials, 10-15% of participants had ≥ 3 conditions overall, while in osteoporosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease trials 40-60% of participants had ≥ 3 conditions overall.
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity and multimorbidity are less common in trials than in community populations with the same index condition. Comorbidity and multimorbidity are, nevertheless, common in trials. This suggests that standard, industry-funded clinical trials are an underused resource for investigating treatment effects in people with comorbidity and multimorbidity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31711480">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> THE CONCISE GUIDE TO PHARMACOLOGY 2019/20: G protein-coupled receptors.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2019/20 is the fourth in this series of biennial publications.

These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key references and suggestions for further reading. The landscape format of the Concise Guide is designed to facilitate comparison of related targets from material contemporary to mid-2019, and supersedes data presented in the 2017/18, 2015/16 and 2013/14 Concise Guides and previous Guides to Receptors and Channels. It is produced in close conjunction with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR), therefore, providing official IUPHAR classification and nomenclature for human drug targets, where appropriate.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-11<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31710715">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The best from East and West? Acupuncture and medical training therapy as monotherapies or in combination for adult patients with episodic and chronic tension-type headache: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a complex health intervention, based on the combination of conventional Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), in an outpatient department of a university hospital for patients with frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective randomized controlled pilot study with four balanced treatment arms (usual care, acupuncture, training, and training plus acupuncture). Each arm will have 24 patients. After the initial screening examination and randomization, a 6-week treatment period follows, with treatment frequencies decreasing at 2-week intervals. After completion of the intervention, two follow-up evaluations will be performed 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. At predefined times, the various outcomes (pain intensity, health-related quality of life, pain duration, autonomic regulation, and heart rate variability) as well as the participants' acceptance of the complex treatment will be evaluated with valid assessment instruments (Migraine Disability Assessment, PHQ-D, GAD-7, and SF-12) and a headache diary. The acupuncture treatment will be based on the rules of TCM, comprising a standardized combination of acupuncture points and additional points selected according to individual pain localization. The training therapy comprises a combination of strength training, endurance training, and training to improve flexibility and coordination. Besides descriptive analyses of the samples, their comparability will be assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or chi-squared tests. Analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Potential interaction effects will be calculated using a repeated-measures ANOVA to test the primary and secondary hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, the proportion of treatment responders (those with a 50% reduction in the frequency of pain episodes) will be determined for each treatment arm.
DISCUSSION: This trial may provide evidence for the additive effects of acupuncture and medical training therapy as a combination treatment and may scientifically support the implementation of this complex health intervention.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 56 862 participants enrolled (21% response rate) into the Mayo Clinic Biobank from Rochester, Minnesota (77%, n=43 836), Jacksonville, Florida (18%, n=10 368) and La Crosse, Wisconsin (5%, n=2658). Participants were all Mayo Clinic patients, 18 years of age or older and US residents.
FINDINGS TO DATE: Overall, 43% of participants were 65 years of age or older and female participants were more frequent (59%) than males at all sites. Most participants resided in the Upper Midwest regions of the USA (Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois or Wisconsin), Florida or Georgia. Self-reported race among Biobank participants was 90% white. Here we provide examples of the types of studies that have successfully utilised the resource, including (1) investigations of the population itself, (2) provision of controls for case-control studies, (3) genotype-driven research, (4) EHR-based research and (5) prospective recruitment to other studies. Over 270 projects have been approved to date to access Biobank data and/or samples; over 200 000 sample aliquots have been approved for distribution.
FUTURE PLANS: The data and samples in the Mayo Clinic Biobank can be used for various types of epidemiological and clinical studies, especially in the setting of case-control studies for which the Biobank samples serve as control samples. We are planning cohort studies with additional follow-up and acquisition of genetic information on a large scale.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31699749">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pharmacological signatures of the reduced incidence and the progression of cognitive decline in ageing populations suggest the protective role of beneficial polypharmacy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Preventive treatments for dementia are warranted. Here we show that utilization of certain combinations of prescription medications and supplements correlates with reduced rates of cognitive decline. More than 1,900 FDA-approved agents and supplements were collapsed into 53 mechanism-based groups and traced in electronic medical records (EMRs) for >50,000 patients. These mechanistic groups were aligned with the data presented in more than 300 clinical trials, then regression model was built to fit the signals from EMRs to clinical trial performance. While EMR signals of each single agents correlated with clinical performance relatively weakly, the signals produced by combinations of active compounds were highly correlated with the clinical trial performance (R = 0.93, p = 3.8 x10^-8). Higher ranking pharmacological modalities were traced in patient profiles as their combinations, producing protective complexity estimates reflecting degrees of exposure to beneficial polypharmacy. For each age strata, the higher was the protective complexity score, the lower was the prevalence of dementia, with maximized life-long effects for the highest regression score /diversity compositions. The connection was less strong in individuals already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Confounder analysis confirmed an independent effect of protective complexity in multivariate context. A sub-cohort with lifelong odds of dementia decreased > 5-folds was identified; this sub-cohort should be studied in further details, including controlled clinical trials. In short, our study systematically explored combinatorial preventive treatment regimens for age-associated multi-morbidity, with an emphasis on neurodegeneration, and provided extensive evidence for their feasibility.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693707">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Depression in middle and older adulthood: the role of immigration, nutrition, and other determinants of health in the Canadian longitudinal study on aging.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Little is known about depression in middle-aged and older Canadians and how it is affected by health determinants, particularly immigrant status. This study examined depression and socio-economic, health, immigration and nutrition-related factors in older adults.
METHODS: Using weighted comprehensive cohort data from the baseline Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (n = 27,162) of adults aged 45-85, gender-specific binary logistic regression was conducted with the cross-sectional data using the following variables: 1) Depression (outcome) measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression (CESD-10) rating scale; 2) Immigration status: native-born, recent and mid-term (< 20 years), and long-term immigrants (≥20 years); and 3) covariates: socioeconomic status, physical health (e.g., multi-morbidity), health behavior (e.g., substance use), over-nutrition (e.g., anthropometrics), under-nutrition (e.g., nutrition risk), and dietary intake.
RESULTS: The sample respondents were mainly Canadian-born (82.6%), women (50.6%), 56-65 years (58.9%), earning between C$50,000-99,999 (33.2%), and in a relationship (69.4%). When compared to Canadian-born residents, recent, mid-term (< 20 years), and longer-term (≥ 20 years) immigrant women were more likely to report depression and this relationship was robust to adjustments for 32 covariates (adjusted ORs = 1.19, 2.54, respectively, p < 0.001). For women, not completing secondary school (OR = 1.23, p < 0.05), stage 1 hypertension (OR = 1.31, p < 0.001), chronic pain (OR = 1.79, p < 0.001), low fruit/vegetable intakes (OR = 1.33, p < 0.05), and fruit juice (OR = 1.80, p < 0.001), chocolate (ORs = 1.15-1.66, p's < 0.05), or salty snack (OR = 1.19, p < 0.05) consumption were associated with depression. For all participants, lower grip strength (OR = 1.25, p < 0.001) and high nutritional risk (OR = 2.24, p < 0.001) were associated with depression. For men, being in a relationship (OR = 0.62, p < 0.001), completing post-secondary education (OR = 0.82, p < 0.05), higher fat (ORs = 0.67-83, p's < 0.05) and omega-3 egg intake (OR = 0.86, p < 0.05) as well as moderate intakes of fruits/vegetables and calcium/high vitamin D sources (ORs = 0.71-0.743, p's < 0.05) predicted a lower likelihood of depression. For men, chronic conditions (ORs = 1.36-3.65, p's < 0.001), chronic pain (OR = 1.86, p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.17, p < 0.001), or chocolate consumption (ORs = 1.14-1.72, p's < 0.05) predicted a higher likelihood of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The odds of developing depression were highest among immigrant women. Depression in middle-aged and older adults is also associated with socioeconomic, physical, and nutritional factors and the relationships differ by sex.

Methods: In this nationwide, population-based cohort study conducted from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2013, we identified 22,058 women with no prior history of stroke, who experienced symptomatic menopausal transition at ≥45 years of age. Moreover, 22,058 women without symptomatic menopause were matched by propensity scores and enrolled as a comparison group. The propensity score was calculated by using all characteristic variables of each subject, including demographics (age and monthly income), comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dysrhythmia, peripheral artery occlusive disease), Charlson's comorbidity index score, clinic visit frequency, and long-term medications (antihypertensives, antidiabetic agents, statins, antiplatelets, aspirin, warfarin, and hormone replacement therapy). The primary endpoint was the development of stroke after the onset of symptomatic menopausal transition. The Fine and Gray's proportional subhazards model was performed to assess the association between symptomatic menopausal transition and subsequent stroke. All subjects were followed up until December 31, 2013.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 8.5 years (standard deviation 4.7 years, maximum 14 years), 2,274 (10.31%) women with symptomatic menopausal transition, and 1,184 (5.37%) matched comparison participants developed stroke. The incidence rates were 11.17 per 1,000 person-years in the symptomatic menopausal transition group compared with 8.57 per 1,000 person-years in the comparison group. The risk of developing stroke was significantly higher in women with symptomatic menopausal transition (crude subhazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.22-1.41]; 
Conclusion: In this large-scale retrospective cohort study, symptomatic menopausal transition was statistically significantly associated with a 30% increased risk of stroke.

Medications have low efficacy and are often associated with adverse effects. Given that FM is associated with a defective endogenous pain control system and central sensitisation, combining interventions such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and aerobic exercise (AE) to modulate pain-processing circuits may enhance pain control.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective, randomised (1:1:1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, factorial clinical trial will test the hypothesis that optimised tDCS (16 anodal tDCS sessions combined with AE) can restore of the pain endogenous control system. Participants with FM (n=148) will undergo a conditioning exercise period and be randomly allocated to one of four groups: (1) active tDCS and AE, (2) sham tDCS and AE, (3) active tDCS and non-aerobic exercise (nAE) or (4) sham tDCS and nAE. Pain inhibitory activity will be assessed using conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and temporal slow pain summation (TSPS)-primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will include the following assessments: Transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography as cortical markers of pain inhibitory control and thalamocortical circuits; secondary clinical outcomes on pain, FM, quality of life, sleep and depression. Finally, the relationship between the two main mechanistic targets in this study-CPM and TSPS-and changes in secondary clinical outcomes will be tested. The change in the primary efficacy endpoint, CPM and TSPS, from baseline to week 4 of stimulation will be tested with a mixed linear model and adjusted for important demographic variables.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study obeys the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Partners Healthcare under the protocol number 2017P002524. Informed consent will be obtained from participants. Study findings will be reported in conferences and peer-reviewed journal publications.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study on 100 critically ill patients with agitation in Kasralainy Hospital over the period from May 2016 to June 2017.patients were divided into two groups, each group included 50 patients, 1st group patients received Depakene orally, and 2nd group patients received haloperidol by i.v infusion for 72 h. Richmond agitation sedation score and doses of additional sedative drugs were noted and calculated daily in the first three days.
RESULTS: Our study showed that valproate was equal in efficacy in controlling agitation; decreasing the RAAS significantly after 48 h from initiation (2.52 ± 0.61 vs 0.28 ± 0.54 with p < 0.001) for Depakene and (2.6 ± 0.67 vs 0.34 ± 0.48 with p < 0.001) for haloperidol. There was also a decrease in the doses of additional sedative drugs used to control agitation (midazolam & propofol) after 48 h from drug initiation. Both drugs therapy was associated with decrease in heart rate (89 ± 20 vs 86.6 ± 13.6 with p = 0.002 for valproate and 99.8 ± 23.3 vs 91 ± 16.7 with p < 0.001 for haloperidol).

Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity.

DM was induced with streptozotocin, and AMI with isoproterenol. Eight groups of seven Wister Bratislava rats were included in the study. The N-C was the normal control group, AMI-C was the group with AMI, DM-C was the group with DM, and DM-AMI-C was the group with DM and AMI. All four groups received saline solution orally during the whole experiment. S-DM-CUS-AMI and S-DM-CUN-AMI groups received saline for seven days prior to DM induction and continued with CUS (200 mg/kg bw, bw = body weight) for S-DM-CUS-AMI and CUN for S-DM-CUN-AMI (200 mg/kg bw) for 15 days before AMI induction. The CUS-DM-CUS-AMI group received CUS (200 mg/kg bw), while the CUN-DM-CUN-AMI received CUN (200 mg/kg bw) for seven days prior to DM induction, and both groups continued with administration in the same doses for 15 days before AMI induction. CUS and CUN prevented elevation of creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase in all groups, with better results in the CUN (S-DM-CUN-AMI and CUN-DM-CUN-AMI groups). CUS and CUN significantly reduced serum levels of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, the indirect assessment of nitric oxide synthesis, and total oxidative status) and enhanced antioxidative markers (total antioxidative capacity and thiols, up to 2.5 times). All groups that received CUS or CUN showed significantly lower serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β.

The aim of this study was to evaluate gender-specific relationships between CHD and other comorbidities.
Methods: We analyzed data from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey (DEGS1), a national survey of 8152 adults aged 18-79 years. Female and male participants with self-reported CHD were compared for 23 chronic medical conditions. Regression models were applied to determine potential associations between CHD and these 23 conditions.
Results: The prevalence of CHD was 9% (547 participants): 34% (185) were female CHD participants and 66% (362) male. In women, CHD was associated with hypertension (OR = 3.28 (1.81-5.9)), lipid disorders (OR = 2.40 (1.50-3.83)), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.08 (1.24-3.50)), kidney disease (OR = 2.66 (1.101-6.99)), thyroid disease (OR = 1.81 (1.18-2.79)), gout/high uric acid levels (OR = 2.08 (1.22-3.56)) and osteoporosis (OR = 1.69 (1.01-2.84)). In men, CHD patients were more likely to have hypertension (OR = 2.80 (1.94-4.04)), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.87 (1.29-2.71)), lipid disorder (OR = 1.82 (1.34-2.47)), and chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.28 (1.81-5.9)).
Conclusion: Our analysis revealed two sets of chronic conditions associated with CHD. The first set occurred in both women and men, and comprised known risk factors: hypertension, lipid disorders, kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. The second set appeared unique to women: thyroid disease, osteoporosis, and gout/high uric acid.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether anxiety, sleep quality, and self-efficacy of patients have mediating effects in the relationship of patient-reported physician empathy and inflammatory factor in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 242 patients attended by 45 doctors. Self-reported doctors' empathy ability was measured at patient admission (T1), and patient-reported physician empathy was measured 3 months later (T2). Patient anxiety, general self-efficacy, sleep, and inflammatory factor (IL-6) were measured on T1 and T2. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between self-reported doctor empathy ability and patient indices on T1 and T2. The relationships between anxiety, sleep quality, self-efficacy, IL-6, and patient-reported physician empathy were measured by Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling. RESULTS On T1, no significant correlation was reported between self-reported doctors' empathy ability and indices of the patients (P>0.05). On T2, self-reported doctors' empathy ability was significantly positively correlated with patient sleep and self-efficacy (P<0.01), and significantly negatively correlated with patient anxiety and IL-6 (P<0.01). Moreover, on T2, patient-reported physician empathy was negatively correlated with anxiety and IL-6 and was positively correlated with self-efficacy and sleep quality.

In an attempt to address this challenge, we collected and integrated data connecting metabolites, plants, diseases, and proteins. A mechanistic hypothesis is generated when a metabolite is known to be present in a given plant, that plant is known to be used to treat a certain disease, that disease is known to be linked to the function of a given protein, and that protein is finally known or predicted to interact with the original metabolite. The construction of plant-protein networks from mutually connected metabolites and diseases facilitated the identification of plausible mechanisms of action for plants being used to treat analgesia, hypercholesterolemia, diarrhea, catarrh, and cough. Additional concrete examples using both experimentally known and computationally predicted, and subsequently experimentally confirmed, metabolite-protein interactions to close the connection circle between metabolites, plants, diseases, and proteins offered further proof of concept for the validity and scope of the approach to generate mode of action hypotheses for some of the therapeutic uses of remedial herbs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-21<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632273">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Stroke follow-up in primary care: a Norwegian modelling study on the implications of multimorbidity for guideline adherence.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Specialized acute treatment and high-quality follow-up is meant to reduce mortality and disability from stroke. While the acute treatment for stroke takes place in hospitals, the follow-up of stroke survivors largely takes place in general practice. National guidelines give recommendations for the follow-up. However, previous studies suggest that guidelines are not sufficiently adhered to. It has been suggested that this might be due to the complexity of general practice. A part of this complexity is constituted by patients' multimorbidity; the presence of two or more chronic conditions in the same person. In this study we investigated the extent of multimorbidity among stroke survivors residing in the communities. The aim was to assess the implications of multimorbidity for the follow-up of stroke in general practice.
METHODS: The study was a cross sectional analysis of the prevalence of multimorbidity among stroke survivors in Mid-Norway. We included 51 patients, listed with general practitioners in 18 different clinics. The material consists of the general practitioners' medical records for these patients. The medical records for each patient were reviewed in a search for diagnoses corresponding to a predefined list of morbidities, resulting in a list of chronic conditions for each participant. These 51 lists were the basis for the subsequent analysis. In this analysis we modelled different hypothetical patients and assessed the implications of adhering to all clinical guidelines affecting their diseases.
RESULT: All 51 patients met the criteria for multimorbidity. On average the patients had 4.7 (SD: 1.9) chronic conditions corresponding to the predefined list of morbidities. By modelling implications of guideline adherence for a patient with an average number of co-morbidities, we found that 10-11 annual consultations with the general practitioner were needed for the follow-up of the stable state of the chronic conditions. More consultations were needed for patients with more complex multimorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity had a clear impact on the basis for the follow-up of patients with stroke in general practice. Adhering to the guidelines for each condition is challenging, even for patients with few co-morbidities. For patients with complex multimorbidity, adhering to the guidelines is obviously unmanageable.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-19<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627726">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Sumatriptan Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy; the Headache of the Heart: A Case Report.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) is an increasing recognized form of acute reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction not related to obstructive coronary disease.

METHODS: All individuals enrolled in the DMP COPD were included in the analysis. Patients were only excluded if they were not insured or not enrolled in the DMP COPD the complete year before the last DMP documentation (at physician visit), had a missing forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV
RESULTS: More severe COPD was significantly associated with higher healthcare utilization, work absence, and premature retirement. Adjusted annual costs for GOLD grade 1 to 4 amounted to €3809 [€3691-€3935], €4284 [€4176-€4394], €5548 [€5328-€5774], and €8309 [€7583-9065] for direct costs, and €11,784 [€11,257-€12,318], €12,985 [€12,531-13,443], €15,805 [€15,034-€16,584], and €19,402 [€17,853-€21,017] for indirect costs. Comorbidities had significant additional effects on direct and indirect costs with factors ranging from 1.19 (arthritis) to 1.51 (myocardial infarction) in direct and from 1.16 (myocardial infarction) to 1.27 (cancer) in indirect costs.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that more severe GOLD grades in an unselected COPD population enrolled in a structured DMP are associated with tremendous additional direct and indirect costs, with comorbidities significantly increase costs. In direct cost category hospitalization and in indirect cost category premature retirement were the main cost driver. From a societal perspective prevention and interventions focusing on disease control, and slowing down disease progression and strengthening the ability to work would be beneficial in order to realize cost savings in COPD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-11<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601216">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> "Photobiomics": Can Light, Including Photobiomodulation, Alter the Microbiome?<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596658">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Resident physicians' perceptions of ambulatory care pharmacy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Physicians' acceptance of clinical pharmacy services is dependent on exposure to those services, with use increasing as resident physicians progress through their training. Resident physicians train within environments that have a multidisciplinary teaching and clinical care approach, working closely with other healthcare professionals. Ambulatory care pharmacists are increasingly working with resident physicians in clinic settings as part of the multidisciplinary team, and identification of resident physicians' perceptions may influence future collaboration.
Objective: The objective of this research is to evaluate the perception of ambulatory care clinical pharmacy services from the perspective of resident physicians.
Methods: A statewide network of ambulatory care pharmacists was identified and received an electronic questionnaire. Pharmacists working within clinics that serve as training sites for resident physicians then completed and distributed questionnaires to the resident physicians within their clinical site. Items related to demographics and perception of involvement and interactions with clinical pharmacists.
Results: Forty-five resident physicians responded from four unique clinical sites (response rate = 42%). They agreed or strongly agreed that pharmacists help patients obtain their therapeutic goals (97.8%), are able to educate patients effectively (95.6%), provide high quality care (97.8%), and do a good job helping co-manage patients (91.1%). Previous exposure to pharmacists was limited primarily to the drugstore (48.9%) and hospital (51.1%) settings. Resident physicians in the third year of training and those reporting a friend was a pharmacist, were more likely to have a positive perception of the pharmacist's role as a resident educator (p=0.048 and p=0.044, respectively).
Conclusions: Resident physicians with a longer duration of exposure and personal friendship with a pharmacist are more likely to express positive perceptions. Areas for further enhancements in this interprofessional relationship related to perceptions about pharmacist autonomy and patient relationships were identified.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-08<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592291">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> ADMA as a possible marker of endothelial damage.

In this last group it can represents a prelude to stroke and cognitive impairment. Still nowadays, its pathogenesis is unclear. 35 consecutive patients with SVD at brain MRI and 35 age- and sex-matched controls, between January 2016 and February 2018, underwent an extended screening for thrombophilia, autoimmunity and evaluated levels of blood markers of inflammation and endothelial activation. Asymmetric DiMethyl Arginine (ADMA) levels proved higher in patients (70.44 ± 36.25 ng/ml vs. 46.58 ± 30.67 ng/ml; p = 0.004), also after controlling for confounding factors. ADMA levels showed positive correlation with Fazekas score (r = 0.304; p = 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed a moderate accuracy in discriminating patients and controls (AUC = 0.70; CI 0.57-0.82; p = 0.004): a cut-off of 46 ng/ml is associated with 80% sensitivity, but limited (54%) specificity. Higher ADMA levels characterize selected subjects with sporadic SVD, asymptomatic for vascular diseases and without latent inflammatory conditions or coagulopathy. This reinforces the hypothesis of the key role of endothelial dysfunction in SVD. Further studies should explore the cause-effect relationship between ADMA pathway and SVD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578412">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Interplay of Objective Sleep Duration and Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases on Cause-Specific Mortality.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs) and cancer are leading causes of death.

More research is required to gain a deeper understanding of the disease and its clinical presentation. To estimate the incidence of tinnitus and to describe patient-related characteristics such as lifestyle factors and comorbidities.
Patients and methods: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we calculated incidence rates of first-time diagnosed tinnitus in an adult population between 2000 and 2016. We stratified incidence rates by sex, age, and year of diagnosis. Additionally, we performed a 1:1 matched case-control study comparing body mass index, lifestyle factors and selected comorbidities between patients with incident tinnitus and tinnitus-free controls.
Results: We identified 109 783 adults with a first-time diagnosis of tinnitus between 2000 and 2016, yielding an overall age-standardized incidence rate of 25.0 new tinnitus cases per 10,000 person-years (95% CI: 24.6-25.5). There was a steady increase in tinnitus incidence throughout the study period. Approximately 80% of tinnitus cases were diagnosed at age 40 years or older. We observed the highest incidence rate in individuals aged 60-69 years (41.2 per 10,000 person-years, 95% CI: 40.7-41.7). Smokers and alcohol drinkers were at lower risk of being diagnosed with tinnitus compared with non-smokers and non-drinkers, respectively. The occurrence of tinnitus was strongly associated with a recent diagnosis of several otological and vestibular disorders as well as head and neck disorders.
Conclusion: The present observational study found an increasing incidence of tinnitus over time, emphasizing the continuously growing health burden. The findings on patient characteristics, lifestyle factors, and selected comorbidities contribute to a better understanding of risk factors for tinnitus.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-01<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572016">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Integrated prevention and management of non-communicable diseases, including musculoskeletal health: a systematic policy analysis among OECD countries.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Introduction: Development and implementation of appropriate health policy is essential to address the rising global burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The aim of this study was to evaluate existing health policies for integrated prevention/management of NCDs among Member States of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We sought to describe policies' aims and strategies to achieve those aims, and evaluate extent of integration of musculoskeletal conditions as a leading cause of global morbidity.
Methods: Policies submitted by OECD Member States in response to a World Health Organization (WHO) NCD Capacity Survey were extracted from the WHO document clearing-house and analysed following a standard protocol. Policies were eligible for inclusion when they described an integrated approach to prevention/management of NCDs. Internal validity was evaluated using a standard instrument (sum score: 0-14; higher scores indicate better quality). Quantitative data were expressed as frequencies, while text data were content-analysed and meta-synthesised using standardised methods.
Results: After removal of duplicates and screening, 44 policies from 30 OECD Member States were included. Three key themes emerged to describe the general aims of included policies: system strengthening approaches; improved service delivery; and better population health. Whereas the policies of most countries covered cancer (83.3%), cardiovascular disease (76.6%), diabetes/endocrine disorders (76.6%), respiratory conditions (63.3%) and mental health conditions (63.3%), only half the countries included musculoskeletal health and pain (50.0%) as explicit foci. General strategies were outlined in 42 (95.5%) policies-all were relevant to musculoskeletal health in 12 policies, some relevant in 27 policies and none relevant in three policies. Three key themes described the strategies: general principles for people-centred NCD prevention/management; enhanced service delivery; and system strengthening approaches. Internal validity sum scores ranged from 0 to 13; mean: 7.6 (95% CI 6.5 to 8.7).
Conclusion: Relative to other NCDs, musculoskeletal health did not feature as prominently, although many general prevention/management strategies were relevant to musculoskeletal health improvement.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-30<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565419">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Current Knowledge on Correlations Between Highly Prevalent Dental Conditions and Chronic Diseases: An Umbrella Review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Studies have investigated the relationships between chronic systemic and dental conditions, but it remains unclear how such knowledge can be used in clinical practice. In this article, we provide an overview of existing systematic reviews, identifying and evaluating the most frequently reported dental-chronic disease correlations and common risk factors.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of existing systematic reviews (umbrella review) published between 1995 and 2017 and indexed in 4 databases. We focused on the 3 most prevalent dental conditions and 10 chronic systemic diseases with the highest burden of disease in Germany. Two independent reviewers assessed all articles for eligibility and methodologic quality using the AMSTAR criteria and extracted data from the included studies.
RESULTS: Of the initially identified 1,249 systematic reviews, 32 were included for qualitative synthesis. The dental condition with most frequently observed correlations to chronic systemic diseases was periodontitis. The chronic systemic disease with the most frequently observed correlations with a dental condition was type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most dental-chronic disease correlations were found between periodontitis and T2DM and periodontitis and cardiovascular disease. Frequently reported common risk factors were smoking, age, sex, and overweight. Using the AMSTAR criteria, 2 studies were assessed as low quality, 26 studies as moderate quality, and 4 studies as high quality.
CONCLUSION: The quality of included systematic reviews was heterogeneous. The most frequently reported correlations were found for periodontitis with T2DM and for periodontitis with cardiovascular disease. However, the strength of evidence for these and other disease correlations is limited, and the evidence to assess the causality of these disease correlations remains unclear. Future research should focus on the causality of disease links in order to provide more decisive evidence with respect to the design of intersectoral care processes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560644">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Shared Genetics of Psychiatric Disorders.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Until recently, advances in understanding the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders have been impeded by a historic, and often mandated, commitment to the use of traditional, and unvalidated, categorical diagnoses in isolation as the relevant phenotype. Such studies typically required lengthy structured interviews to delineate differences in the character and duration of behavioral symptomatology amongst disorders that were thought to be etiologic, and they were often underpowered as a result. Increasing acceptance of the fact that co-morbidity in psychiatric disorders is the rule rather than the exception has led to alternative designs in which shared dimensional symptomatology is analyzed as a quantitative trait and to association analyses in which combined polygenic risk scores are computationally compared across multiple traditional categorical diagnoses to identify both distinct and unique genetic and environmental elements. Increasing evidence that most mental disorders share many common genetic risk variants and environmental risk modifiers suggests that the broad spectrum of psychiatric pathology represents the pleiotropic display of a more limited series of pathologic events in neuronal development than was originally believed, regulated by many common risk variants and a smaller number of rare ones.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559010">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Leptin and Associated Mediators of Immunometabolic Signaling: Novel Molecular Outcome Measures for Neurostimulation to Treat Chronic Pain.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Chronic pain is a devastating condition affecting the physical, psychological, and socioeconomic status of the patient. Inflammation and immunometabolism play roles in the pathophysiology of chronic pain disorders. Electrical neuromodulation approaches have shown a meaningful success in otherwise drug-resistant chronic pain conditions, including failed back surgery, neuropathic pain, and migraine. A literature review (PubMed, MEDLINE/OVID, SCOPUS, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles) was performed using the following search terms: chronic pain disorders, systemic inflammation, immunometabolism, prediction, biomarkers, metabolic disorders, and neuromodulation for chronic pain. Experimental studies indicate a relationship between the development and maintenance of chronic pain conditions and a deteriorated immunometabolic state mediated by circulating cytokines, chemokines, and cellular components. A few uncontrolled in-human studies found increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines known to drive metabolic disorders in chronic pain patients undergoing neurostimulation therapies. In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge and possible relationships of available neurostimulation therapies for chronic pain with mediators of central and peripheral neuroinflammation and immunometabolism on a molecular level. However, to address the needs for predictive factors and biomarkers, large-scale databank driven clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical value of molecular profiling.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554241">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A New Kid on the Block?

BACKGROUND: The management of people with multiple chronic diseases challenges health care systems designed around single disease. Patients with multimorbidity often receive highly fragmented care that may lead to inefficient, ineffective and potentially harmful treatments and neglect of essential health needs. A more comprehensive, person-centered approach is advocated for persons with multiple morbidities. However, examples on how to provide more person-centered care and evidence of its impact are scarce. A group of Dutch general practitioners (GPs) took the initiative to develop such a care approach.
METHODS/DESIGN: Mixed methods with a development and pilot-testing phase. The proactive person-centered approach will be developed using an action-based research design consisting of multiple plan-act-observe-reflect-adjust cycles. In each cycle, experiences of patients and primary care professionals from 13 practices will be collected via interviews, observations and focus groups. Starting point for the first cycle is a 'person-centered consultation' of up to 1 h in which the GP discusses the health status and health care needs of the patient. Furthermore, shared decisions between GP and patient are made on treatment goals and follow-up. In the pilot-test phase, a nested case cohort study allows to explore the impact of the new approach on 'Quadruple aim' outcomes comparing persons with and without exposure to the new care approach.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide a proactive person-centered approach for persons with multimorbidity in primary care and estimate its potential impact on quadruple outcomes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547898">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Individual Adaptation in Cross-Country Skiing Based on Tracking during Training Conditions.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Research on heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and blood pressure (BP) during specific training stages is less common in endurance athletes, whereas resting BP and HR are less studied in relationship to HR<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547420">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Paradox of Coenzyme Q<br><b>Abstract:</b> Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is an essential endogenously synthesized molecule that links different metabolic pathways to mitochondrial energy production thanks to its location in the mitochondrial inner membrane and its redox capacity, which also provide it with the capability to work as an antioxidant.

A total of 244 patients were included, of whom 7 were lost to follow-up. Among the analyzed 237 subjects who completed 3-year follow-up, 30 experienced MACCE and 38 experienced perioperative AEs. Preoperative PLA was higher in subjects who developed MACCE (13.32%) than in those who did not (8.69%, p = 0.040).

Although many studies focused on etiology, diagnostic and treatment of TTC, precise clinical guidelines on TTC are not available. Research revealed emotional and physical triggering factors of TTC and emphasized the association of TTC with psychiatric and particularly acute neurological disorders. Similar clinical presentation of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and TTC patients, makes an anamnestic screening for TTC risk factors necessary. In psychiatric anamnesis affective disorders and chronic anxiety disorders are presumably for TTC. Subarachnoid hemorrhages and status epilepticus are typical acute neurological associated with a higher risk for TTC. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reveled brain alterations of the limbic system and reduced connectivity of central autonomic nervous system structures. Diagnosis of TTC is made by elevation of cardiac enzymes, electrocardiogram (ECG) and visualization of myocardial wall motion.

The activation of TRPV1 may be involved in the regulation of various physiological functions, such as the release of inflammatory mediators in the body, gastrointestinal motility function, and temperature regulation. In recent years, a large number of studies have revealed that TRPV1 plays an important role in the physiological and pathological conditions of the digestive system, cardiovascular system, and respiratory system, but there is no systematic report on TRPV1. The objective of this review is to explain the function and effects of TRPV1 on specific diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, hypertension, and asthma, and to further investigate the intrinsic relationship between the expression and function of TRPV1 in those diseases to find new therapeutic targets for the cure of related diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496955">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cardioprotective Melatonin: Translating from Proof-of-Concept Studies to Therapeutic Use.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In this review we summarized the actual clinical data for a cardioprotective therapeutic role of melatonin, listed melatonin and its agonists in different stages of development, and evaluated the melatonin cardiovascular target tractability and prediction using machine learning on ChEMBL. To date, most clinical trials investigating a cardioprotective therapeutic role of melatonin are in phase 2a. Selective melatonin receptor agonists Tasimelteon, Ramelteon, and combined melatonergic-serotonin Agomelatine, and other agonists with registered structures in CHEMBL were not yet investigated as cardioprotective or cardiovascular drugs. As drug-able for these therapeutic targets, melatonin receptor agonists have the benefit over melatonin of well-characterized pharmacologic profiles and extensive safety data. Recent reports of the X-ray crystal structures of MT1 and MT2 receptors shall lead to the development of highly selective melatonin receptor agonists. Predictive models using machine learning could help to identify cardiovascular targets for melatonin. Selecting ChEMBL scores > 4.5 in cardiovascular assays, and melatonin scores > 4, we obtained 284 records from 162 cardiovascular assays carried out with 80 molecules with predicted or measured melatonin activity. Melatonin activities (agonistic or antagonistic) found in these experimental cardiovascular assays and models include arrhythmias, coronary and large vessel contractility, and hypertension.

METHODS: Incident CKD patients from 2000 to 2013 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan and they were classified as non-AF (
RESULTS: Compared with CKD patients without AF, those with prevalent or incident AF were associated with higher adjusted rates of ESRD (hazard ratio (HR), 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-1.48; HR, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.74-3.09, respectively), stroke or systemic thromboembolism (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.77-2.03; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.54-1.81, respectively), AMI (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.09-1.41; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.75-2.27, respectively), all-cause mortality (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.56-1.72; HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 2.06-2.29, respectively), and CV mortality (HR, 2.95; 95% CI, 2.62-3.32; HR, 4.61; 95% CI, 4.09-5.20, respectively). Intriguingly, CKD patients with prevalent AF were associated with lower adjusted rates of ESRD, AMI, all-cause mortality, and CV mortality compared with those with incident AF.
CONCLUSION: Both incident and prevalent AF were independently associated with greater risks of AMI, all-cause mortality, CV mortality, ESRD, and stroke or systemic thromboembolism.

Functionally, microcirculation is virtually inseparable from other nervous system cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. For successful bench-to-bedside translation of neuroprotection research, the role of microcirculation in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders appears to be under-recognized, which may have contributed to clinical trial failures with some neuroprotectants. Increasing data over the last decade suggest that microcirculatory impairments such as endothelial or pericyte dysfunction, morphological irregularities in capillaries or frequent dynamic stalls in blood cell flux resulting in excessive heterogeneity in capillary transit may significantly compromise tissue oxygen availability. We now know that ischemia-induced persistent abnormalities in capillary flow negatively impact restoration of reperfusion after recanalization of occluded cerebral arteries. Similarly, microcirculatory impairments can accompany or even precede neural loss in animal models of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Macrovessels are relatively easy to evaluate with radiological or experimental imaging methods but they cannot faithfully reflect the downstream microcirculatory disturbances, which may be quite heterogeneous across the tissue at microscopic scale and/or happen fast and transiently. The complexity and size of the elements of microcirculation, therefore, require utilization of cutting-edge imaging techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution as well as multidisciplinary team effort to disclose microvascular-neurodegenerative connection and to test treatment approaches to advance the field. Developments in two photon microscopy, ultrafast ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography provide valuable experimental tools to reveal those microscopic events with high resolution. Here, we review the up-to-date advances in understanding of the primary microcirculatory abnormalities that can result in neurodegenerative processes and the combined neurovascular protection approaches that can prevent acute as well as chronic neurodegeneration.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-02<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474933">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Soft clustering using real-world data for the identification of multimorbidity patterns in an elderly population: cross-sectional study in a Mediterranean population.<br><b>Abstract:</b> OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify, with soft clustering methods, multimorbidity patterns in the electronic health records of a population ≥65 years, and to analyse such patterns in accordance with the different prevalence cut-off points applied. Fuzzy cluster analysis allows individuals to be linked simultaneously to multiple clusters and is more consistent with clinical experience than other approaches frequently found in the literature.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted based on data from electronic health records.
SETTING: 284 primary healthcare centres in Catalonia, Spain (2012).

This model continues to be a valuable approach for the search and development of new phytochemicals consumed as medicinal plants or foods. In most cases, the sources of phytochemicals have been used in folk medicine to treat ailments that include hypertension. In this model, the endothelium is emphasized as a key component that modulates the vessel contractility, and therefore the basal tone and blood pressure. Based on the functional nature of the model, we focused on studies that determined the endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatory activity of phytochemicals. We describe the mechanisms that account for aorta contraction and relaxation, and subsequently show the vasoactive effect of a series of phytochemicals acting as vasodilators and its endothelium dependence. We highlight information regarding the cardiovascular benefits of phytochemicals, especially their potential antihypertensive effect.

Main body: The pathogenesis of obesity includes the balance between calories consumed and energy expenditure followed by the maintenance of body weight. Diet, physical activity, environmental, behavioral and physiological factors are part of the complex process of weight loss, since there are several hormones and peptides involved in regulation of appetite, eating behavior and energy expenditure. The cardiovascular complications associated to obesity are also driven by processes involving hormones and peptides and which include inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, coronary calcification, activation of coagulation, renin angiotensin or the sympathetic nervous systems. Pharmacological treatments are often needed to insure weight loss and weight maintenance as adjuncts to diet and physical activity in people with obesity and overweight patients.
Conclusion: To accomplish satisfactory goals, patients and physicians seek for weight loss, weight maintenance and improvement of the risk factors associated to this condition, especially cardiovascular risk.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-30<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467596">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation promotes anti-aging miRNA expression profile in the aorta of aged mice, predicting epigenetic rejuvenation and anti-atherogenic effects.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Understanding molecular mechanisms involved in vascular aging is essential to develop novel interventional strategies for treatment and prevention of age-related vascular pathologies. Recent studies provide critical evidence that vascular aging is characterized by NAD+ depletion. Importantly, in aged mice, restoration of cellular NAD+ levels by treatment with the NAD+ booster nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) exerts significant vasoprotective effects, improving endothelium-dependent vasodilation, attenuating oxidative stress, and rescuing age-related changes in gene expression. Strong experimental evidence shows that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has a role in vascular aging. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that age-related NAD+ depletion is causally linked to dysregulation of vascular miRNA expression. A corollary hypothesis is that functional vascular rejuvenation in NMN-treated aged mice is also associated with restoration of a youthful vascular miRNA expression profile. To test these hypotheses, aged (24-month-old) mice were treated with NMN for 2 weeks and miRNA signatures in the aortas were compared to those in aortas obtained from untreated young and aged control mice. We found that protective effects of NMN treatment on vascular function are associated with anti-aging changes in the miRNA expression profile in the aged mouse aorta. The predicted regulatory effects of NMN-induced differentially expressed miRNAs in aged vessels include anti-atherogenic effects and epigenetic rejuvenation. Future studies will uncover the mechanistic role of miRNA gene expression regulatory networks in the anti-aging effects of NAD+ booster treatments and determine the links between miRNAs regulated by NMN and sirtuin activators and miRNAs known to act in the conserved pathways of aging and major aging-related vascular diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463647">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Current Status of Clinical Diagnosis and Genetic Analysis of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia in South Korea: Multicenter Case Series and a Systematic Review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a rare genetic vascular disorder, has been rarely reported in South Korea. We investigated the current prevalence and presenting patterns of genetically confirmed HHT in South Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We defined HHT patients as those with proven mutations on known HHT-related genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) or those fulfilling 3 or 4 of the Curaçao criteria. A computerized systematic search was performed in PubMed and KoreaMed using the following search term: ("hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia" AND "Korea") OR ("Osler-Weber-Rendu" AND "Korea"). We also collected government health insurance data. HHT genetic testing results were collected from three tertiary hospitals in which the genetic tests were performed. We integrated patient data by analyzing each case to obtain the prevalence and presenting pattern of HHT in South Korea.
RESULTS: We extracted 90 cases from 52 relevant articles from PubMed and KoreaMed. An additional 22 cases were identified from the three Korean tertiary hospitals after excluding seven cases that overlapped with those in the published articles. Finally, 112 HHT patients were identified (41 males and 71 females, aged 4-82 years [mean±standard deviation, 45.3±20.6 years]). The prevalence of HHT in South Korea is about 1 in 500,000, with an almost equal prevalence among men and women. Forty-nine patients underwent genetic testing, of whom 28 had HHT1 (ENG mutation) and 19 had HHT2 (ACVRL1 mutation); the other two patients were negative for ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 mutations.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HHT is underestimated in Korea. The rate of phenotypic presentation seems to be similar to that found worldwide. Korean health insurance coverage is limited to representative genetic analysis to detect ENG and ACVRL1 mutations. Further genetic analyses to detect HHT3, HHT4, and other forms of HHT should be implemented.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455059">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Adaptive substitutions underlying cardiac glycoside insensitivity in insects exhibit epistasis in vivo.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Predicting how species will respond to selection pressures requires understanding the factors that constrain their evolution.

Adolescents spend most of their waking hours in school; however, there is limited research available on how school nurses can address chronic pain among adolescents in the Swedish school context. Therefore, we designed a person-centred intervention, known as Help Overcoming Pain Early (HOPE), to enable school nurses to offer adolescents strategies to manage their stress and pain. We used the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and designing this new complex intervention. For this study, we describe two of the four phases: (a) development and (b) feasibility and piloting. The final version of the HOPE programme consists of (i) an educational package for school nurses in the areas person-centred care, stress and pain education/management and gender perspective; and (ii) an intervention package for adolescents with chronic pain. The programme consists of four sessions during which adolescents with chronic pain have person-centred dialogues with a school nurse. The HOPE programme is based on the existing evidence of managing chronic pain and on the assumption that school nurses can support adolescents with chronic pain by using person-centred care.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450645">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Breakthrough of Biosimilars: A Twist in the Narrative of Biological Therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The coming wave of patent expiries of first generation commercialized biotherapeutical drugs has seen the global market open its doors to close copies of these products. These near perfect substitutes, which are termed as "biosimilars", do not need to undergo intense clinical trials for their approval. However, they are mandated to produce identical similarity from their reference biologics in terms of clinical safety and efficacy. As such, these biosimilar products promise to foster unprecedented access to a wide range of life-saving biologics. However, seeing this promise be fulfilled requires the development of biosimilars to be augmented with product trust, predictable regulatory frameworks, and sustainable policies. It is vital for healthcare and marketing professionals to understand the critical challenges surrounding biosimilar use and implement informed clinical and commercial decisions. A proper framework of pharmacovigilance, education, and scientific exchange for biologics and biosimilars would ensure a dramatic rise in healthcare access and market sustainability.

Evidence is scarce on the risks of specific cardiovascular diseases in survivors of a wide range of cancers to inform prevention and management. In this study, we used large-scale electronic health records data from multiple linked UK databases to address these evidence gaps.
METHODS: For this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary care, hospital, and cancer registry data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify cohorts of survivors of the 20 most common cancers who were 18 years or older and alive 12 months after diagnosis and controls without history of cancer, matched for age, sex, and general practice. We compared risks for a range of cardiovascular disease outcomes using crude and adjusted Cox models. We fitted interactions to investigate effect modification, and flexible parametric survival models to estimate absolute excess risks over time.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015, 126 120 individuals with a diagnosis of a cancer of interest still being followed up at least 1 year later were identified and matched to 630 144 controls. After exclusions, 108 215 cancer survivors and 523 541 controls were included in the main analyses. Venous thromboembolism risk was elevated in survivors of 18 of 20 site-specific cancers compared with that of controls; adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) ranged from 1·72 (95% CI 1·57-1·89) in patients after prostate cancer to 9·72 (5·50-17·18) after pancreatic cancer. HRs decreased over time, but remained elevated more than 5 years after diagnosis. We observed increased risks of heart failure or cardiomyopathy in patients after ten of 20 cancers, including haematological (adjusted HR 1·94, 1·66-2·25, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; 1·77, 1·50-2·09, with leukaemia; and 3·29, 2·59-4·18, with multiple myeloma), oesophageal (1·96, 1·46-2·64), lung (1·82, 1·52-2·17) kidney (1·73, 1·38-2·17) and ovarian (1·59, 1·19-2·12). Elevated risks of arrhythmia, pericarditis, coronary artery disease, stroke, and valvular heart disease were also observed for multiple cancers, including haematological malignancies. HRs for heart failure or cardiomyopathy and venous thromboembolism were greater in patients without previous cardiovascular disease and in younger patients. However, absolute excess risks were generally greater with increasing age. Increased risks of these outcomes seemed most pronounced in patients who had received chemotherapy.
INTERPRETATION: Survivors of most site-specific cancers had increased medium-term to long-term risk for one or more cardiovascular diseases compared with that for the general population, with substantial variations between cancer sites.

BACKGROUND: PVI is a commonly used procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), and its efficacy has usually been judged against therapy with anti-arrhythmic drugs in open-label trials. There have been several RCTs of AF ablation in which both arms received an ablation, but the difference between the treatment arms was inclusion or omission of PVI. These trials of an ablation strategy with PVI versus an ablation strategy without PVI may provide a more rigorous method for evaluating the efficacy of PVI.
METHODS: Medline and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs comparing ablation including PVI with ablation excluding PVI. The primary efficacy endpoint was freedom from atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial tachycardia at 12 months. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using the restricted maximum likelihood estimator.
RESULTS: Overall, 6 studies (n = 610) met inclusion criteria. AF recurrence was significantly lower with an ablation including PVI than an ablation without PVI (RR: 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33 to 0.89; p = 0.0147; I

Since utilization of a drug reaches a peak about 12-14 years after it was launched, we allow for considerable lags in the relationship between new drug launches and the burden of disease. We analyze the impact of new drug launches on a comprehensive measure of disease burden-the age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years lost (DALY) rate-and on its two components: the age-standardized years of life lost (YLL) and years lost to disability (YLD) rates. We also analyze the impact of new drug launches on the number of hospital discharges and on the average length of hospital stays. The number of DALYs lost is significantly inversely related to the number of drugs that had ever been launched 9-20 years earlier, and the number of YLLs is significantly inversely related to the number of drugs that had ever been launched 11-20 years earlier. The launch of a drug has the largest (most negative) impact on the number of DALYs and YLLs 15 years after it was launched. The estimates indicate that if no drugs had been launched during 1986-2001, the age-standardized DALY rate would not have declined between 2000 and 2016; it might even have increased. Almost all (93%) of the reduction in DALYs was due to a reduction in YLL. The estimates imply that new drug launches during 1986-2001 reduced DALYs in 2016 by 21%, reduced YLLs in 2016 by 28%, and reduced YLDs in 2016 by 3%. We estimate that drugs launched during 1986-2001 reduced the number of DALYs lost in 2016 by 2.31 million. Expenditure in 2016 on drugs launched during 1986-2001 per DALY gained in 2016 from those drugs was 2842 USD. Interventions that avert one DALY for less than average per capita income for a given country or region are generally considered to be very cost-effective; Canada's per capita GDP was 42,158 USD in 2016, so our estimates indicate that the new drugs launched during 1986-2001 were very cost-effective, overall. Moreover, 2842 USD may be an overestimate of the true net cost in 2016 per DALY of drugs launched during 1986-2001. A previous study based on U.S. data showed that about 25% of the cost of new drugs is offset by reduced expenditure on old drugs. Also, our estimates indicate that, if no drugs had been launched during 1986-2001, the average length of 2016 hospital stays would have been about 16% higher. The reduction in hospital expenditure due to shorter average length of stay may have been larger than the expenditure on the drugs responsible for shorter hospital stays.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-23<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440578">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Health and Aging: Unifying Concepts, Scores, Biomarkers and Pathways.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Despite increasing research efforts, there is a lack of consensus on defining aging or health.

An exaggerated activation of the sympathetic-nervous-system (SNS) following stressful psychosocial life events is discussed to be of key importance. In this experimental study, we tested whether TTC patients, compared to heart-healthy controls, respond more strongly to supporting placebo interventions and stressful nocebo interventions targeting cardiac function. In a single experimental session, 20 female TTC patients and 20 age matched (mean age 61.5 years, ± 12.89) catheter-confirmed heart-healthy women were examined. Saline solution was administered three times i.v. to all participants, with the verbal suggestion they receive an inert substance with no effects on the heart (neutral condition), a drug that would support cardiac functions (positive condition), and a drug that would burden the heart (negative condition). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP/SBP), heart rate (HR), endocrine markers cortisol (µg/dl), copeptin (pmol/l), and subjective stress ratings (SUD) were assessed to examine alterations of the SNS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Before and after each intervention SUD was rated. One pre and three post serum cortisol and copeptin samples were assessed, and a long-term electrocardiogram as well as non-invasive, continuous blood pressure was recorded. The study design elucidated a significant increase of SUD levels as a response to the nocebo intervention, while perceived stress remained unaffected during the preceding neutral and positive interventions. Increasing SUD levels were accompanied by higher SBP and an anticipatory increase of HR shortly prior to the nocebo intervention. SBP increased also as a response to positive verbal suggestions (Bonferroni-corrected p-values > .05). Alterations of cortisol and copeptin due to the interventions and significant placebo effects failed to appear. Interestingly no differences between TCC patients and controls could be found.These findings do not support the assumption of an exaggerated activation of the SNS as a discriminatory factor for TTC. Since especially the nocebo intervention revealed negative subjective and objective effects, our results underscore the urgent need to consider carefully the impact of verbal suggestions in the interaction with cardiac patients in daily clinical routine.

The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is a well-studied neuroimmune interaction involving the vagus nerve. CD4-positive T cells expressing β2 adrenergic receptors and macrophages expressing the alpha 7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the spleen receive neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and acetylcholine and are key mediators of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that vagus nerve stimulation, ultrasound, and restraint stress elicit protective effects against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. These protective effects are induced primarily via activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. In addition to these immunological roles, nervous systems are directly related to homeostasis of renal physiology. Whole-kidney three-dimensional visualization using the tissue clearing technique CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain/body imaging cocktails and computational analysis) has illustrated that renal sympathetic nerves are primarily distributed around arteries in the kidneys and denervated after ischemia-reperfusion injury. In contrast, artificial renal sympathetic denervation has a protective effect against kidney disease progression in murine models. Further studies are needed to elucidate how neural networks are involved in progression of kidney disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-19<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422643">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Increased Incidence of Glaucoma in Sensorineural Hearing Loss: A Population-Based Cohort Study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the incidence of glaucoma in patients diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) via the application of the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with a diagnosis of SNHL were enrolled in the study group after an exclusion procedure and a propensity score matched group without SNHL was served as the control group with a 1:2 ratio. The main outcome was regarded as the emergence of glaucoma diagnostic codes. Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to analyze the incidence and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of glaucoma in the multivariate model. A total of 15,686 patients diagnosed with SNHL were enrolled in the study group while another 31,372 non-SNHL individuals served as the control group. There were 444 glaucoma events in the study group and 647 glaucoma events in those non-SNHL individuals after the follow-up interval of 16 years. The study group demonstrated a significantly higher aHR compared to the control group after adjusting for multiple possible risk factors. In the subgroup analysis, both the normal tension glaucoma and angle closure glaucoma subgroups revealed a higher aHR in the study group. In conclusion, the patients with SNHL demonstrated a higher incidence of developing glaucoma.

BACKGROUND: The MAST Study is a 2017 study of US adults with migraine that profiles current treatment patterns and identifies and quantifies unmet treatment needs.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from an online survey of US adults meeting ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine. For inclusion in this paper, respondents self-reported a history of 3 or more monthly headache days (MHDs) in the past 3 months and at least 1 MHD in the past 30 days, and current use of orally administered acute prescription medication for headache. Three domains of unmet need were identified: inadequate treatment response (ie, inadequate 2-hour pain freedom, recurrence within 24 hours of initial relief), demanding attack characteristics (rapid onset of attack, headache associated with sleep), and unique patient characteristics (opioid or barbiturate overuse, cardiovascular comorbidity). Sociodemographics, oral medication use, and coexisting conditions and symptoms (ie, level of treatment optimization, psychological symptoms, attack-related cutaneous allodynia, and migraine symptom severity) were assessed for each domain and by the number of unmet need domains.
RESULTS: Overall, 15,133 respondents met inclusion criteria, 26.0% (3930/15,133) reported current use of oral acute prescription medication to treat headache. Eligible participants had a mean age of 45.0 years, 73.6% [2892/3930] were women and 81.1% [3186/3930]) were White. A total of 95.8% (3765/3930) of respondents had at least 1 unmet acute treatment need; 89.5% (3516/3930) reported demanding attack characteristics, 74.1% (2912/3930) reported inadequate treatment response, and 16.1% (634/3930) presented with unique patient characteristics. Common areas of unmet need were rapid headache onset (65.3% [2567/3930]), moderate to severe disability (55.6% [2187/3930]), inadequate 2-hours pain freedom (49.0% [1892/3930]), and headache recurrence within 24 hours (38.0% [1493/3930]). An increasing number of unmet treatment need domains was associated with worsening psychological symptoms, attack-related cutaneous allodynia and migraine symptom severity.
CONCLUSION: Nearly all MAST Study respondents using acute oral prescription medications for migraine reported at least 1 unmet treatment need.

Methodology: NP was induced by CCI. Animals were divided into a sham group, an NP group, and a miR-1906 mimic group, which received 500 nmol/kg of a miR-1906 mimic intrathecally for 10 consecutive days following surgery. The effect of miR-1906 agomir was determined by estimating the thermal and mechanical withdrawal latency; an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the concentration of proinflammatory mediators. Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine protein expression in the spinal tissues of the CCI-induced neuropathic pain rat model.
Results: Administration of miR-1906 agomir increased the mechanical and thermal withdrawal latency period and the levels of inflammatory mediators compared with the NP group. Western blotting showed that treatment with miR-1906 agomir attenuated the levels of Akt, mTOR, TLR-4, and PI3K proteins in the spinal tissues of the CCI-induced neuropathic pain model. TLR-4 and NF-κB gene expression was lower in the miR-1906 agomir group than in the NP group.
Conclusion: miR-1906 gene stimulation reduced neuropathic pain by enhancing Akt/nTOR/PI3K and TLR-4/NF-κB pathway regulation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-14<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410300">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Effects of Prevalent and Incident Chronic Kidney Disease on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-known complication of atrial fibrillation (AF) but how the incident CKD affects the clinical outcomes amongst AF patients is not clear.
METHODS: Our study data were retrieved from National Health Insurance Research Data for the period from 1996 to 2013. Incident AF patients were classified as non-CKD group (
RESULTS: The mean age was 70.8 ± 13.3 years, and 55.4% of the studied population were men. In Cox models, the adjusted rate of HF, AMI, all-cause mortality, and CV mortality was greater in the prevalent and incident CKD groups, ranging from 1.31-fold to 4.28-fold, compared with non-CKD group. Notably, incident CKD was associated with higher rates of HF (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.67-1.93), stroke or systemic thromboembolism (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.22-1.45), AMI (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.25-1.71), all-cause mortality (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.68-1.85), and CV mortality (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.92-2.36) compared with prevalent CKD.
CONCLUSION: The presence of CKD was associated with higher risks of subsequent adverse clinical outcomes in patients with AF.

The burden of stroke in terms of mortality, morbidity and disability is increasing across the world. It is currently observed to be one of the commonest reasons of admission in many health care setups and becoming an alarming serious public health problem in our country Ethiopia. Despite the high burden of strokes globally, there is insufficient information on the current clinical profile of stroke in low and middle income countries (LMICs) including Ethiopia. So, this study was aimed to assess risk factors, clinical presentations and predictors of stroke subtypes among adult patients admitted to stroke unit of Jimma university medical center (JUMC).
METHODS: Prospective observational study design was carried out at stroke unit (SU) of JUMC for 4 consecutive months from March 10-July 10, 2017. A standardized data extraction checklist and patient interview was used to collect data. Data was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of stroke subtypes.
RESULT: A total of 116 eligible stroke patients were recruited during the study period. The mean age of the patients was 55.1 ± 14.0 years and males comprised 62.9%. According to world health organization (WHO) criteria of stroke diagnosis, 51.7% of patients had ischemic while 48.3% had hemorrhagic stroke. The most common risk factor identified was hypertension (75.9%) followed by family history (33.6%), alcohol intake (22.4%), smoking (17.2%) and heart failure (17.2%). The most common clinical presentation was headache complained by 75.0% of the patients followed by aphasia 60.3% and hemiparesis 53.4%. Atrial fibrillation was the independent predictor of hemorrhagic stroke (AOR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.68).
CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics of stroke in this set up were similar to other low- and middle-resource countries.

We conducted this study to determine the risk for DM among physicians in Taiwan.
METHODS: We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 28,440 physicians and 56,880 comparisons (general population) matched at a ratio of 1:2 by age and sex. Participants who had been diagnosed with DM before 2007 were excluded. We compared the risk for DM between physicians and comparisons by following up since 2007 to 2013. Comparisons among physician subgroups were also performed.
RESULTS: After adjustment for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and polycystic ovary syndrome, physicians had a lower risk for DM than the comparisons (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.82). In comparisons among physicians, emergency physicians (AOR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.44-3.40) and surgeons (AOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.05-1.52) had a higher risk for DM than other specialists.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that physicians have a lower risk for DM than the general population and emergency physicians and surgeons have a higher risk for DM than other specialists.

However, the existence of a trigeminovagal complex in humans remains unclear. This study, therefore investigated the existence of the trigeminovagal complex in humans. One post-mortem human brainstem was scanned at 11.7T to obtain structural (T1-weighted) and diffusion magnetic resonance images ((d)MR images). Post-processing of dMRI data provided track density imaging (TDI) maps to investigate white matter at a smaller resolution than the imaging resolution. To evaluate the reconstructed tracts, the MR-scanned brainstem and three additional brainstems were sectioned for polarized light imaging (PLI) microscopy. T1-weighted images showed hyperintense vagus medullar striae, coursing towards the dorsomedial aspect of the medulla. dMRI-, TDI- and PLI-images showed these striae to intersect the trigeminal spinal tract (sp5) in the lateral medulla. In addition, PLI images showed that a minority of vagus fibers separated from the vagus trajectory and joined the trigeminal spinal nucleus (Sp5) and the sp5. The course of the vagus tract in the rostral medulla was demonstrated in this study. This study shows that the trigeminal- and vagus systems interconnect anatomically at the level of the rostral medulla where the vagus fibers intersect with the Sp5 and sp5.

The expression of mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) disrupts the functions of brain cells. Galectin-3 (Gal3) is a lectin that has not been extensively explored in brain diseases. Herein, we showed that the plasma Gal3 levels of HD patients and mice correlated with disease severity. Moreover, brain Gal3 levels were higher in patients and mice with HD than those in controls. The up-regulation of Gal3 in HD mice occurred before motor impairment, and its level remained high in microglia throughout disease progression. The cell-autonomous up-regulated Gal3 formed puncta in damaged lysosomes and contributed to inflammation through NFκB- and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pathways. Knockdown of Gal3 suppressed inflammation, reduced mHTT aggregation, restored neuronal DARPP32 levels, ameliorated motor dysfunction, and increased survival in HD mice. Thus, suppression of Gal3 ameliorates microglia-mediated pathogenesis, which suggests that Gal3 is a novel druggable target for HD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375685">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Curcumin Nanoparticles Protect against Isoproterenol Induced Myocardial Infarction by Alleviating Myocardial Tissue Oxidative Stress, Electrocardiogram, and Biological Changes.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Curcumin from <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374848">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Do β-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs associate with reduced risk of symptomatic osteoarthritis and total joint replacement in the general population?

A need exists to better understand the active components required for effective self-management support, how these might be delivered within primary care, and the training and system changes that would subsequently be needed.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine self-management support interventions in primary care on health outcomes for a wide range of diseases compared to usual standard of care; and (2) To identify the effective strategies that facilitate positive clinical and humanistic outcomes in this setting.
METHOD: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating self-management support interventions was conducted following the Cochrane handbook & PRISMA guidelines. Published literature was systematically searched from inception to June 2019 in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligible studies assessed the effectiveness of individualized interventions with follow-up, delivered face-to-face to adult patients with any condition in primary care, compared with usual standard of care. Matrices were developed that mapped the evidence and components for each intervention. The methodological quality of included studies were appraised.
RESULTS: 6,510 records were retrieved. 58 studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Findings reveal a structured patient-provider exchange is required in primary care (including a one-on-one patient-provider consultation, ongoing follow up and provision of self-help materials). Interventions should be tailored to patient needs and may include combinations of strategies to improve a patient's disease or treatment knowledge; independent monitoring of symptoms, encouraging self-treatment through a personalized action plan in response worsening symptoms or exacerbations, psychological coping and stress management strategies, and enhancing responsibility in medication adherence and lifestyle choices. Follow-up may include tailored feedback, monitoring of progress with respect to patient set healthcare goals, or honing problem-solving and decision-making skills. Theoretical models provided a strong base for effective SMS interventions. Positive outcomes for effective SMS included improvements in clinical indicators, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy (confidence to self-manage), disease knowledge or control. An SMS model has been developed which sets the foundation for the design and evaluation of practical strategies for the construct of self-management support interventions in primary healthcare practice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide primary care professionals with evidence-based strategies and structure to deliver SMS in practice. For this collaborative partnership approach to be more widely applied, future research should build on these findings for optimal SMS service design and upskilling healthcare providers to effectively support patients in this collaborative process.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-01<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369582">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Prevalence and Overlap of Potential Embolic Sources in Patients With Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background We aimed to assess the prevalence and degree of overlap of potential embolic sources (PES) in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Methods and Results In a pooled data set derived from 3 prospective stroke registries, patients were categorized in ≥1 groups according to the PES that was/were identified. We categorized PES as follows: atrial cardiopathy, atrial fibrillation diagnosed during follow-up, arterial disease, left ventricular disease, cardiac valvular disease, patent foramen ovale, and cancer. In 800 patients with ESUS (43.1% women; median age, 67.0 years), 3 most prevalent PES were left ventricular disease, arterial disease, and atrial cardiopathy, which were present in 54.4%, 48.5%, and 45.0% of patients, respectively. Most patients (65.5%) had >1 PES, whereas only 29.7% and 4.8% of patients had a single or no PES, respectively. In 31.1% of patients, there were ≥3 PES present. On average, each patient had 2 PES (median, 2). During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, stroke recurrence occurred in 101 (12.6%) of patients (23.3 recurrences per 100 patient-years). In multivariate analysis, the risk of stroke recurrence was higher in the atrial fibrillation group compared with other PES, but not statistically different between patients with 0 to 1, 2, or ≥3 PES. Conclusions There is major overlap of PES in patients with ESUS. This may possibly explain the negative results of the recent large randomized controlled trials of secondary prevention in patients with ESUS and offer a rationale for a randomized controlled trial of combination of anticoagulation and aspirin for the prevention of stroke recurrence in patients with ESUS.

Preoperative opioid use may be associated with worse clinical and safety outcomes after TKR.
Objective: To determine the association of preoperative opioid use among patients 65 years and older with mortality and other complications at 30 days post-TKR.
Design, Setting, And Participants: This cohort study used claims data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014, from a random sample of US Medicare enrollees 65 years and older who underwent TKR. Based on opioid dispensing in 360 days prior to TKR, patients were classified as continuous (≥1 opioid dispensing in each of the past 12 months) or intermittent (any dispensing of opioids in the past 12 months but not continuous use) opioid users or as opioid-naive patients (no opioids dispensed in the past 12 months). Data analyses were conducted from October 3, 2017, to November 8, 2018.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and 30-day post-TKR mortality, hospital readmission, and revision operation. Secondary safety outcomes at 30 days post-TKR included opioid overdose and vertebral and nonvertebral fracture.

Results: Of 316 593 patients (mean [SD] age, 73.9 [5.8] years; 214 677 [67.8%] women) who underwent TKR, 22 895 (7.2%) were continuous opioid users, 161 511 (51.0%) were intermittent opioid users, and 132 187 (41.7%) were opioid naive. In-hospital mortality occurred in 276 patients (0.09%). At 30 days post-TKR, 828 patients (0.26%) died, 16 786 patients (5.30%) had hospital readmission, and 921 patients (0.29%) had a revision operation. All primary and secondary outcomes occurred more frequently among continuous opioid users compared with opioid-naive patients. Compared with opioid-naive patients and after adjusting for demographic characteristics, combined comorbidity score, number of different prescription medications, and frailty, continuous opioid users had greater risk of revision operations (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.15-2.32), vertebral fractures (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.37-4.09), and opioid overdose (HR, 4.82; 95% CI, 1.36-17.07) at 30 days post-TKR. However, after adjusting covariates, there were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.73-1.90) or 30-day (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.73-1.51) mortality between continuous opioid users and opioid-naive patients.
Conclusions and Relevance: After adjusting for baseline risk profiles, including comorbidities and frailty, continuous opioid users had a higher risk of revision operations, vertebral fractures, and opioid overdose at 30 days post-TKR but not of in-hospital or 30-day mortality, compared with opioid-naive patients. These results highlight the need for better understanding of patient characteristics associated with chronic opioid use to optimize preoperative assessment of overall risk after TKR.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-31<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365106">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Acupuncture as Adjunctive Therapy for Chronic Stable Angina: A Randomized Clinical Trial.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Importance: The effects of acupuncture as adjunctive treatment to antianginal therapies for patients with chronic stable angina are uncertain.
Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as adjunctive therapy to antianginal therapies in reducing frequency of angina attacks in patients with chronic stable angina.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this 20-week randomized clinical trial conducted in outpatient and inpatient settings at 5 clinical centers in China from October 10, 2012, to September 19, 2015, 404 participants were randomly assigned to receive acupuncture on the acupoints on the disease-affected meridian (DAM), receive acupuncture on the acupoints on the nonaffected meridian (NAM), receive sham acupuncture (SA), and receive no acupuncture (wait list [WL] group). Participants were 35 to 80 years of age with chronic stable angina based on the criteria of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, with angina occurring at least twice weekly. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 1, 2015, to July 30, 2016.
Interventions: All participants in the 4 groups received antianginal therapies as recommended by the guidelines. Participants in the DAM, NAM, and SA groups received acupuncture treatment 3 times weekly for 4 weeks for a total of 12 sessions. Participants in the WL group did not receive acupuncture during the 16-week study period.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants used diaries to record angina attacks. The primary outcome was the change in frequency of angina attacks every 4 weeks from baseline to week 16.
Results: A total of 398 participants (253 women and 145 men; mean [SD] age, 62.6 [9.7] years) were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Baseline characteristics were comparable across the 4 groups. Mean changes in frequency of angina attacks differed significantly among the 4 groups at 16 weeks: a greater reduction of angina attacks was observed in the DAM group vs the NAM group (difference, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.43-5.71; P < .001), in the DAM group vs the SA group (difference, 5.18; 95% CI, 3.54-6.81; P < .001), and in the DAM group vs the WL group (difference, 5.63 attacks; 95% CI, 3.99-7.27; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with acupuncture on the NAM, SA, or no acupuncture (WL), acupuncture on the DAM as adjunctive treatment to antianginal therapy showed superior benefits in alleviating angina.
