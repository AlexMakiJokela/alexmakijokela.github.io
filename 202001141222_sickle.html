There has been an international call for public input to inform a substantive debate about benefits and risks of HGE. This study investigates the views of the sickle cell disease (SCD) community. We utilized a mixed-methods approach to examine SCD stakeholders' views in the United States. We found SCD stakeholders hold a nuanced view of HGE. Assuming the technology is shown to be safe and effective, they are just as supportive of HGE as genetics professionals, but more supportive than the general public. However, they are also concerned about the potential implications of HGE, despite this support. As discourse surrounding HGE advances, it is crucial to engage disease communities and other key stakeholders whose lives could be altered by these interventions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Brittany M Hollister, Mariclare C Gatter, Khadijah E Abdallah, Alyssa J Armsby, Ashley J Buscetta, Yen Ji Julia Byeon, Kayla E Cooper, Stacy Desine, Anitra Persaud, Kelly E Ormond, Vence L Bonham<br><b>Journal:</b> CRISPR J<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2573-1602<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 1.0<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.19<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31742431">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gene Therapy For Beta-Thalassemia: Updated Perspectives.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was until very recently, the only permanent curative option available for patients suffering from transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Gene therapy, by autologous transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells, currently represents a novel therapeutic promise, after many years of extensive preclinical research for the optimization of gene transfer protocols. Nowadays, clinical trials being held on a worldwide setting, have demonstrated that, by re-establishing effective hemoglobin production, patients may be rendered transfusion- and chelation-independent and evade the immunological complications that normally accompany allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The present review will offer a retrospective scope of the long way paved towards successful implementation of gene therapy for beta-thalassemia, and will pinpoint the latest strategies employed to increase globin expression that extend beyond the classic transgene addition perspective. A thorough search was performed using Pubmed in order to identify studies that provide a proof of principle on the aforementioned topic at a preclinical and clinical level. Inclusion criteria also regarded gene transfer technologies of the past two decades, as well as publications outlining the pitfalls that precluded earlier successful implementation of gene therapy for beta-thalassemia. Overall, after decades of research, that included both successes and pitfalls, the path towards a permanent, donor-irrespective cure for beta-thalassemia patients is steadily becoming a realistic approach.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-02<br><b>Authors:</b> Garyfalia Karponi, Nikolaos Zogas<br><b>Journal:</b> Appl Clin Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-704X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 1.0<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.17<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.745<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576160">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Highly efficient editing of the β-globin gene in patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to treat sickle cell disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder that affects millions worldwide. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only available cure. Here, we demonstrate the use of CRISPR/Cas9 and a short single-stranded oligonucleotide template to correct the sickle mutation in the β-globin gene in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from peripheral blood or bone marrow of patients with SCD, with 24.5 ± 7.6% efficiency without selection. Erythrocytes derived from gene-edited cells showed a marked reduction of sickle cells, with the level of normal hemoglobin (HbA) increased to 25.3 ± 13.9%. Gene-corrected SCD HSPCs retained the ability to engraft when transplanted into non-obese diabetic (NOD)-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice with detectable levels of gene correction 16-19 weeks post-transplantation. We show that, by using a high-fidelity SpyCas9 that maintained the same level of on-target gene modification, the off-target effects including chromosomal rearrangements were significantly reduced. Taken together, our results demonstrate efficient gene correction of the sickle mutation in both peripheral blood and bone marrow-derived SCD HSPCs, a significant reduction in sickling of red blood cells, engraftment of gene-edited SCD HSPCs in vivo and the importance of reducing off-target effects; all are essential for moving genome editing based SCD treatment into clinical practice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-30<br><b>Authors:</b> So Hyun Park, Ciaran M Lee, Daniel P Dever, Timothy H Davis, Joab Camarena, Waracharee Srifa, Yankai Zhang, Alireza Paikari, Alicia K Chang, Matthew H Porteus, Vivien A Sheehan, Gang Bao<br><b>Journal:</b> Nucleic Acids Res.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1362-4962<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.43<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.3<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.14<br><b>SJR:</b> 8.636<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147717">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sickle cell disease afflicts millions of people worldwide and approximately 100,000 Americans. Complications are myriad and arise as a result of complex pathological pathways 'downstream' to a point mutation in DNA, and include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia and pain, and ultimately risk of cumulative organ damage with reduced lifespan of affected individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies will be widely available to most patients with sickle cell disease. To date, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children, and significantly ameliorated by gene therapy in a handful of subjects who have only limited follow-up thus far. During a timespan in which over 20 agents were approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration, similar approval was granted for only two drugs for sickle cell disease (hydroxyurea and L-glutamine) despite the higher prevalence of sickle cell disease. This trajectory appears to be changing, as the lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry who, in the last decade, have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction, inhibition of intracellular HbS polymerization, inhibition of oxidant stress and inflammation, and perturbation of the activation of the endothelium and other blood components (e.g. platelets, white blood cells, coagulation proteins) involved in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. In this article, we present a crash-course review of disease-modifying approaches (minus hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) for patients with sickle cell disease currently, or recently, tested in clinical trials in the era following approval of hydroxyurea.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Marcus A Carden, Jane Little<br><b>Journal:</b> Haematologica<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1592-8721<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.43<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.17<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.077<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413089">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Expression analysis data of BCL11A and γ-globin genes in KU812 and KG-1 cell lines after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BCL11A enhancer deletion.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled as "Targeted deletion of the BCL11A gene by CRISPR-Cas9 system for fetal hemoglobin reactivation: A promising approach for gene therapy of beta-thalassemia disease " [1]. BCL11A is a master regulator of γ-globin gene silencing, and suppresses fetal hemoglobin expression by association with other γ-globin suppressors, and also interacts with human beta-globin locus control region as well as intergenic region between the Aγ and δ-globin genes to reconfigure beta-globin cluster. Thus, HbF reactivation has been proposed to be an approach for the treatment of β-thalassemia through knockout of BCL11A. Accordingly, an erythroid enhancer sequence was identified that, when inactivated, led to repression of BCL11A and induction of γ-globin in the erythroid lineage [2-7].

Iron overload (IO) is a common complication in BT patients affecting several organs. However, data on the BM stromal compartment are scarce.
METHODS: MSCs were isolated and characterized from BM aspirates of healthy donors (HDs) and BT patients. The state of IO was assessed and correlated with the presence of primitive MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Hematopoietic supportive capacity of MSCs was evaluated by transwell migration assay and 2D coculture of MSCs with human CD34+ HSCs. In vivo, the ability of MSCs to facilitate HSC engraftment was tested in a xenogenic transplant model, whereas the capacity to sustain human hematopoiesis was evaluated in humanized ossicle models.
RESULTS: We report that, despite iron chelation, BT BM contains high levels of iron and ferritin, indicative of iron accumulation in the BM niche. We found a pauperization of the most primitive MSC pool caused by increased ROS production in vitro which impaired MSC stemness properties. We confirmed a reduced frequency of primitive MSCs in vivo in BT patients. We also discovered a weakened antioxidative response and diminished expression of BM niche-associated genes in BT-MSCs. This caused a functional impairment in MSC hematopoietic supportive capacity in vitro and in cotransplantation models. In addition, BT-MSCs failed to form a proper BM niche in humanized ossicle models.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an impairment in the mesenchymal compartment of BT BM niche and highlight the need for novel strategies to target the niche to reduce IO and oxidative stress before transplantation.

However, despite growing understanding of the mechanisms of haemoglobin S polymerization and its effects on red blood cells, only two therapies for SCD - hydroxyurea and L-glutamine - are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Moreover, these treatment options do not fully address the manifestations of SCD, which arise from a complex network of interdependent pathophysiological processes. In this article, we review efforts to develop new drugs targeting these processes, including agents that reactivate fetal haemoglobin, anti-sickling agents, anti-adhesion agents, modulators of ischaemia-reperfusion and oxidative stress, agents that counteract free haemoglobin and haem, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-thrombotic agents and anti-platelet agents. We also discuss gene therapy, which holds promise of a cure, although its widespread application is currently limited by technical challenges and the expense of treatment. We thus propose that developing systems-oriented multi-agent strategies on the basis of SCD pathophysiology is needed to improve the quality of life and survival of people with SCD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2018-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Marilyn J Telen, Punam Malik, Gregory M Vercellotti<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Rev Drug Discov<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1474-1784<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.43<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.15<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514970">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Curing Hemoglobinopathies: Challenges and Advances of Conventional and New Gene Therapy Approaches.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Inherited hemoglobin disorders, including beta-thalassemia (BT) and sickle-cell disease (SCD), are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, with a global carrier frequency of over 5%.1 With migration, they are becoming more common worldwide, making their management and care an increasing concern for health care systems. BT is characterized by an imbalance in the α/β-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolytic anemia, and compensatory hemopoietic expansion.1 Globally, there are over 25,000 births each year with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). The currently available treatment for TDT is lifelong transfusions and iron chelation therapy or allogenic bone marrow transplantation as a curative option. SCD affects 300 million people worldwide2 and severely impacts the quality of life of patients who experience unpredictable, recurrent acute and chronic severe pain, stroke, infections, pulmonary disease, kidney disease, retinopathy, and other complications. While survival has been dramatically extended, quality of life is markedly reduced by disease- and treatment-associated morbidity. The development of safe, tissue-specific and efficient vectors, and efficient gene-editing technologies have led to the development of several gene therapy trials for BT and SCD. However, the complexity of the approach presents its hurdles. Fundamental factors at play include the requirement for myeloablation on a patient with benign disease, the age of the patient, and the consequent bone marrow microenvironment. A successful path from proof-ofconcept studies to commercialization must render gene therapy a sustainable and accessible approach for a large number of patients. Furthermore, the cost of these therapies is a considerable challenge for the health care system. While new promising therapeutic options are emerging,3,4 and many others are on the pipeline,5 gene therapy can potentially cure patients. We herein provide an overview of the most recent, likely potentially curative therapies for hemoglobinopathies and a summary of the challenges that these approaches entail.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Irene Motta, Valentina Ghiaccio, Andrea Cosentino, Laura Breda<br><b>Journal:</b> Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2035-3006<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.43<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.13<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.72<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.519<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31700592">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Development of a forward-oriented therapeutic lentiviral vector for hemoglobin disorders.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is being evaluated for hemoglobin disorders including sickle cell disease (SCD).

Clinical trials are currently underway to treat sickle cell disease using LVs expressing designed anti-sickling globin genes. However, because of the large size and complexity of the human β-globin gene, LV products often have low titers and transduction efficiency, requiring large amounts to treat a single patient.

Recently, the genome editing technique for eukaryotic cells called CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) has enriched the field of gene surgery with enhanced applications. In the present review, we summarized the different applications of gene surgery for treating human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, nervous, and cardiovascular diseases, besides the molecular mechanisms involved in these important effects. Several studies support the important therapeutic applications of gene surgery in a large number of health disorders and diseases including β-thalassemia, cancer, immunodeficiencies, diabetes, and neurological disorders. In diabetes, gene surgery was shown to be effective in type 1 diabetes by triggering different signaling pathways. Furthermore, gene surgery, especially that using CRISPR-Cas possessed important application on diagnosis, screening and treatment of several cancers such as lung, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, gene surgery still presents some limitations such as the design difficulties and costs regarding ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases) and TALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) use, off-target effects, low transfection efficiency, <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Ayman El-Kenawy, Bachir Benarba, Adriana Freitas Neves, Thaise Gonçalves de Araujo, Bee Ling Tan, Adel Gouri<br><b>Journal:</b> EXCLI J<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1611-2156<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.43<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.1<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.01<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.612<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31762718">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> In Utero Gene Therapy (IUGT) Using GLOBE Lentiviral Vector Phenotypically Corrects the Heterozygous Humanised Mouse Model and Its Progress Can Be Monitored Using MRI Techniques.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In utero gene therapy (IUGT) to the fetal hematopoietic compartment could be used to treat congenital blood disorders such as β-thalassemia. A humanised mouse model of β-thalassemia was used, in which heterozygous animals are anaemic with splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Intrahepatic in utero injections of a β globin-expressing lentiviral vector (GLOBE), were performed in fetuses at E13.5 of gestation. We analysed animals at 12 and 32 weeks of age, for vector copy number in bone marrow, peripheral blood liver and spleen and we performed integration site analysis. Compared to noninjected heterozygous animals IUGT normalised blood haemoglobin levels and spleen weight. Integration site analysis showed polyclonality. The left ventricular ejection fraction measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in treated heterozygous animals was similar to that of normal non-β-thalassemic mice but significantly higher than untreated heterozygous thalassemia mice suggesting that IUGT ameliorated poor cardiac function.

Premature stop codons are point mutations that disrupt protein synthesis from messenger RNA. As a consequence, patients with premature stop codon diseases have reduced or eliminated protein production from the mutation bearing allele accounting for some of the most severe phenotypes in these genetic diseases. These premature stop codons have been identified in over 1,800 rare and ultra-rare diseases. Read-through therapeutic development is focused on extending mRNA half-life and increasing protein synthesis by enabling the cytoplasmic ribosome to read through premature stop codons to produce full-length proteins. Eloxx’s lead product candidate, ELX-02, is a small molecule drug candidate designed to restore production of full-length functional proteins. ELX-02 is in the early stages of clinical development focusing on cystic fibrosis and cystinosis. ELX-02 is an investigational drug that has not been approved by any global regulatory body.
