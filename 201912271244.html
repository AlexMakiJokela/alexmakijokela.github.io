Biol.<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.949<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.38<br><b>Abstract:</b> CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658261">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunoresponse to Gene-Modified Hematopoietic Stem Cells.<br><b>Authors:</b> Claire M Drysdale, John F Tisdale, Naoya Uchida<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev<br><b>ISSN:</b> Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.487<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.64<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene transfer to and correction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are ideal strategies to cure a number of congenital and acquired disorders. However, transgene products may trigger immunological rejection of modified cells, limiting their therapeutic benefits. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI) allows for efficient engraftment and tolerance to gene-modified HSCs. In contrast, myeloablative chemotherapy using busulfan or similar agents is only sufficient to induce tolerance to gene-modified HSCs producing no or non-immunogenic protein. If cells are modified to produce a protein that is xenogenic or congenitally absent in the patient, additional immunosuppression may be required to prevent an immunological reaction to the transduced cells.

The advent of efficient virus-based methods for delivering therapeutic genes has enabled the development of genetic medicines for inherited disorders of the immune system, hemoglobinopathies, and a number of devastating metabolic diseases. Here, we briefly review the state of the art in the field, including gene editing approaches.

The ability to modify selectively specific genes provides a powerful tool for characterizing gene functions, performing gene therapy, correcting specific genetic mutations, eradicating diseases, engineering cells and organisms to achieve new and different functions and obtaining transgenic animals as models for studying specific diseases. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology has recently revolutionized genome engineering. The application of this new technology to stem cell research allows disease models to be developed to explore new therapeutic tools. The possibility of translating new systems of molecular knowledge to clinical research is particularly appealing for addressing degenerative diseases. In this review, we describe several applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to stem cells related to degenerative diseases. In addition, we address the challenges and future perspectives regarding the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as an important technology in the medical sciences.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768221">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> From fiction to science: clinical potentials and regulatory considerations of gene editing.<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria Schacker, Diane Seimetz<br><b>Journal:</b> Clin Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> Clin Transl Med<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 have emerged as an attractive tool not only for scientific research but also for the development of medicinal products. Their ability to induce precise double strand breaks into DNA enables targeted modifications of the genome including selective knockout of genes, correction of mutations or precise insertion of new genetic material into specific loci. Gene editing-based therapies hold a great potential for the treatment of numerous diseases and the first products are already being tested in clinical trials. The treatment indications include oncological malignancies, HIV, diseases of the hematopoietic system and metabolic disorders. This article reviews ongoing preclinical and clinical studies and discusses how gene editing technologies are altering the gene therapy landscape. In addition, it focusses on the regulatory challenges associated with such therapies and how they can be tackled during the drug development process.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-22<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637541">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Methods and compositions for RNA-directed target DNA modification and for RNA-directed modulation of transcription<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present disclosure provides a DNA-targeting RNA that comprises a targeting sequence and, together with a modifying polypeptide, provides for site-specific modification of a target DNA and/or a polypeptide associated with the target DNA.
