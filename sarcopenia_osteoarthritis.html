Multiplexed functional assays, in which the functional effects of thousands of genomic variants are assessed simultaneously, are increasingly generating data that can be used as additional evidence for or against variant pathogenicity. Such assays have the potential to resolve variants of uncertain significance, thereby increasing the clinical utility of genomic testing. Existing standards from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) and new guidelines from the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) establish the role of functional data in variant interpretation, but do not address the specific challenges or advantages of using functional data derived from multiplexed assays. Here, we build on these existing guidelines to provide recommendations to experimentalists for the production and reporting of multiplexed functional data and to clinicians for the evaluation and use of such data. By following these recommendations, experimentalists can produce transparent, complete, and well-validated datasets that are primed for clinical uptake. Our recommendations to clinicians and diagnostic labs on how to evaluate the quality of multiplexed functional datasets, and how different datasets could be incorporated into the ACMG/AMP variant-interpretation framework, will hopefully clarify whether and how such data should be used. The recommendations that we provide are designed to enhance the quality and utility of multiplexed functional data, and to promote their judicious use.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Gelman, Jennifer N Dines, Jonathan Berg, Alice H Berger, Sarah Brnich, Fuki M Hisama, Richard G James, Alan F Rubin, Jay Shendure, Brian Shirts, Douglas M Fowler, Lea M Starita, None None<br><b>Journal:</b> Genome Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-994X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 10.47<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.084<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862013">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> 34th Annual Meeting & Pre-Conference Programs of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC 2019): part 1 : National Harbor, MD, USA. 6-10 November 2019.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> <br><b>Journal:</b> J Immunother Cancer<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2051-1426<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 8.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.337<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694725">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Effects of rAAV-Mediated <br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene therapy for osteoarthritis offers powerful, long-lasting tools that are well adapted to treat such a slow, progressive disorder, especially those therapies based on the clinically adapted recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors.

Recent studies have proved that epigenetic alteration is involved in a variety of diseases. This work explored the role of histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) in CEP degeneration, as well as its underlying epigenetic mechanisms, and confirmed the effect of EZH2 knockdown on delaying IVDD development.
METHODS: Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and ChIP assay were applied to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of EZH2 in CEP tissue. The therapeutic potential of EZH2 was investigated using puncture-induced rat models.
FINDINGS: The EZH2 expression was upregulated in human and rat CEP tissue. It was also found that the overexpression of EZH2 suppressed the expression of Collagen II, aggrecan and Sox-9, and promoted the expression of ADTAMTS5 and MMP13 in rat endplate chondrocytes (EPCs), which could be reversed by EZH2 silencing. The correlation between EZH2 and Sox-9 was further explored, while overexpression of Sox-9 could reverse the effect of EZH2 in rat EPCs. Moreover, inhibition of EZH2 upregulated the level of Sox-9 by demethylating H3K27me3 at Sox-9 promoter sites, revealing the regulatory mechanism of EZH2 on Sox-9. Meanwhile, puncture-induced rat models showed that EZH2 knockdown exerted a protective effect on CEP and disc degeneration.
INTERPRETATION: This study reveals that EZH2 inhibition is a promising strategy for mitigating the symptoms and progression of IVDD.

Low cell engraftment and dose-dependent side effects linked to the concomitant administration of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are the main problems currently hindering the clinical use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies in this field. We have managed to bypass these drawbacks by combining the silencing the Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase in MSCs with the use of a scaffold that sustainably releases low doses of BMP-2. In this system, Smurf1 silencing is achieved by using GapmeRs, a clinically safe method that avoids the use of viral vectors, facilitating its translation to the clinic. Here, we show that a single transient transfection with a small quantity of a Smurf1-specific GapmeR is able to induce a significant level of silencing of the target gene, enough to prime MSCs for osteogenic differentiation. Smurf1 silencing highly increases MSCs responsiveness to BMP-2, allowing a dramatic reduction of the dose needed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. The combination of these primed cells with alginate scaffolds designed to sustainably and locally release low doses of BMP-2 to the defect microenvironment is able to induce the formation of a mature bone matrix both in an osteoporotic rat calvaria system and in a mouse ectopic model. Importantly, this approach also enhances osteogenic differentiation in MSCs from osteoporotic patients, characterized by a reduced bone-forming potential, even at low BMP doses, underscoring the regenerative potential of this system.

We now identify FGF2 as a factor up-regulated by astrocytes in active inflammatory lesions that disrupts myelination via FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) mediated activation of Wingless (Wnt) signaling; pharmacological inhibition of Wnt being sufficient to abrogate inhibition of myelination by FGF2 in tissue culture.

When treated properly, most fractures will heal well. However, some fractures are difficult to heal. When a fracture does not heal, it is called nonunion. Approximately, 5% of all fracture patients have difficulty healing. Because of the continuous movement of the fracture site, bone nonunion is usually accompanied by pain, which greatly reduces the quality of life of patients. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) play an important role in the process of nonunion. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique kind of noncoding RNA and represent the latest research hotspot in the RNA field. At present, no studies have reported a role of circRNAs in the development of nonunion. After isolation of BMSCs from patients with nonunion, the expression of circRNAs in these cells was detected by using a circRNA microarray. Alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin red staining were used to detect the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by hsa_circ_0074834. The target gene of hsa_circ_0074834 was detected by RNA pull-down and double-luciferase reporter assay. The ability of hsa_circ_0074834 to regulate the osteogenesis of BMSCs in vivo was tested by heterotopic osteogenesis and single cortical bone defect experiments. The results showed that the expression of hsa_circ_0074834 in BMSCs from patients with nonunion was decreased. Hsa_circ_0074834 acts as a ceRNA to regulate the expression of ZEB1 and VEGF through microRNA-942-5p. Hsa_circ_0074834 can promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the repair of bone defects. These results suggest that circRNAs may be a key target for the treatment of nonunion.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxiao Ouyang, Tingting Tan, Xianghong Zhang, Jia Wan, Yanling Zhou, Guangyao Jiang, Daishui Yang, Xiaoning Guo, Tang Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Death Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-4889<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.310<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31804461">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Autophagy regulates the therapeutic potential of adipose-derived stem cells in LPS-induced pulmonary microvascular barrier damage.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been shown to be beneficial in some pulmonary diseases, and the paracrine effect is the major mechanism underlying ADSC-based therapy. Autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining stem cell homeostasis and survival. However, the role of autophagy in mediating ADSC paracrine effects has not been thoroughly elucidated. We examined whether ADSCs participate in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) barrier damage in a paracrine manner and illuminated the role of autophagy in regulating ADSC paracrine effects. PMVECs and ADSCs with or without autophagy inhibition were cocultured without intercellular contact, and the microvascular barrier function was assessed after LPS treatment. ADSC paracrine function was evaluated by detecting essential growth factors for endothelial cells. For in vivo experiments, ADSCs with or without autophagy inhibition were transplanted into LPS-induced lung-injury mice, and lung injury was assessed. ADSCs significantly alleviated LPS-induced microvascular barrier injury. In addition, ADSC paracrine levels of VEGF, FGF, and EGF were induced by LPS treatment, especially in the coculture condition. Inhibiting autophagy weakened the paracrine function and the protective effects of ADSCs on microvascular barrier injury. Moreover, ADSC transplantation alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, and inhibiting autophagy markedly weakened the therapeutic effect of ADSCs on lung injury. Together, these findings show that ADSC paracrine effects play a vital protective role in LPS-induced pulmonary microvascular barrier injury. Autophagy is a positive mediating factor in the paracrine process. These results are helpful for illuminating the role and mechanism of ADSC paracrine effects and developing effective therapies in acute lung injury.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Chichi Li, Jingye Pan, Lechi Ye, Honglei Xu, Beibei Wang, Hanyan Xu, Lingna Xu, Tongtong Hou, Dan Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Death Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-4889<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.310<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645547">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 Controls Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Chondrogenic Differentiation and Functions as a ceRNA.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of cell differentiation and development. However, potential roles for lncRNAs in chondrogenic differentiation have remained poorly understood. Here we identify lncRNA ADAMTS9 antisense RNA 2, ADAMTS9-AS2, which controls the chondrogenic differentiation by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We screen out ADAMTS9-AS2 of undifferentiated and differentiated cells during chondrogenic differentiation by microarrays. Suppression or overexpression of lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 correlates with inhibition and promotion of hMSC chondrogenic differentiation, respectively. We find that ADAMTS9-AS2 can sponge miR-942-5p to regulate the expression of Scrg1, a transcription factor promoting chondrogenic gene expression. Finally, we confirm the function of ADAMTS9-AS2 to cartilage repair in the absence of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in vivo. In conclusion, ADAMTS9-AS2 plays an important role in chondrogenic differentiation as a ceRNA, so that it can be regarded as a therapy target for cartilage repair.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Ming-Jian Huang, Jing-Yu Zhao, Jia-Jia Xu, Jing Li, Yi-Fu Zhuang, Xiao-Ling Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Nucleic Acids<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2162-2531<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.011<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671346">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Latest advances in aging research and drug discovery.<br><b>Abstract:</b> An increasing aging population poses a significant challenge to societies worldwide.

We revealed that senescent ESCs may induce paracrine senescence in young counterparts via cell contacts, secreted factors and extracellular vesicles. According to secretome-wide profiling we identified plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1) to be the most prominent protein secreted by senescent ESCs (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015742). By applying CRISPR/Cas9 techniques we disclosed that PAI-1 secreted by senescent ESCs may serve as the master-regulator of paracrine senescence progression within the ESCs population.

Bone regeneration is one of the main topics of concern in regenerative medicine. In recent years, stem cells have been employed in regenerative medicine with interesting results due to their self-renewal and differentiation capacity. Moreover, stem cells are able to secrete bioactive molecules and regulate the behavior of other cells in different host tissues. Bone regeneration process may improve effectively and rapidly when stem cells are used. To this purpose, stem cells are often employed with biomaterials/scaffolds and growth factors to accelerate bone healing at the fracture site.

If left untreated, unmatured degeneration will cause significant complications. Surgical intervention to repair cartilage may prevent progressive joint degeneration. A series of surgical techniques, including biological augmentation, microfracture and bone marrow stimulation, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and allogenic and autogenic chondral/osteochondral transplantation, have been used for various indications. However, the limited repairing capacity and the potential pitfalls of these techniques cannot be ignored. Increasing evidence has shown promising outcomes from ACI and cartilage transplantation. Nevertheless, the morbidity of autologous donor sites and limited resource of allogeneic bone have considerably restricted the wide application of these surgical techniques.

In particular, trans-acting variants, which are often located on different chromosomes from the genes they affect, are an important source of heritable gene expression variation. However, our knowledge about the identity and mechanism of causal trans-acting variants remains limited. Here, we developed a fine-mapping strategy called CRISPR-Swap and dissected three expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) hotspots known to alter the expression of numerous genes in trans in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Causal variants were identified by engineering recombinant alleles and quantifying the effects of these alleles on the expression of a green fluorescent protein-tagged gene affected by the given locus in trans. We validated the effect of each variant on the expression of multiple genes by RNA-sequencing. The three variants differed in their molecular mechanism, the type of genes they reside in, and their distribution in natural populations. While a missense leucine-to-serine variant at position 63 in the transcription factor Oaf1 (L63S) was almost exclusively present in the reference laboratory strain, the two other variants were frequent among S. cerevisiae isolates. A causal missense variant in the glucose receptor Rgt2 (V539I) occurred at a poorly conserved amino acid residue and its effect was strongly dependent on the concentration of glucose in the culture medium. A noncoding variant in the conserved fatty acid regulated (FAR) element of the OLE1 promoter influenced the expression of the fatty acid desaturase Ole1 in cis and, by modulating the level of this essential enzyme, other genes in trans. The OAF1 and OLE1 variants showed a non-additive genetic interaction, and affected cellular lipid metabolism. These results demonstrate that the molecular basis of trans-regulatory variation is diverse, highlighting the challenges in predicting which natural genetic variants affect gene expression.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Sheila Lutz, Christian Brion, Margaret Kliebhan, Frank W Albert<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS Genet.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1553-7404<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.03<br><b>SJR:</b> 4.001<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31738765">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Principal Criteria for Evaluating the Quality, Safety and Efficacy of hMSC-Based Products in Clinical Practice: Current Approaches and Challenges.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) play an important role as new therapeutic alternatives in advanced therapies and regenerative medicine thanks to their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, and ability to migrate to the exact area of injury. These properties have made hMSCs one of the more promising cellular active substances at present, particularly in terms of the development of new and innovative hMSC-based products. Currently, numerous clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the therapeutic activity of hMSC-based products on specific targets. Given the rapidly growing number of hMSC clinical trials in recent years and the complexity of these products due to their cellular component characteristics and medicinal product status, there is a greater need to define more stringent, specific, and harmonized requirements to characterize the quality of the hMSCs and enhance the analysis of their safety and efficacy in final products to be administered to patients. These requirements should be implemented throughout the manufacturing process to guarantee the function and integrity of hMSCs and to ensure that the hMSC-based final product consistently meets its specifications across batches. This paper describes the principal phases involved in the design of the manufacturing process and updates the specific technical requirements needed to address the appropriate clinical use of hMSC-based products.

In this context, Wharton's jelly (WJ) is an alternative source to bone marrow (BM) for allogeneic transplantation since its isolation does not require an invasive procedure for cell collection and does not raise major ethical concerns. However, the osteogenic capacity of human WJ-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) remains unclear.
METHODS: Here, we compared the baseline osteogenic potential of MSC from WJ and BM cell sources by cytological staining, quantitative real-time PCR and proteomic analysis, and assessed chemical and biological strategies for priming undifferentiated WJ-MSC. Concretely, different inhibitors/activators of the TGFβ1-BMP2 signalling pathway as well as the secretome of differentiating BM-MSC were tested.
RESULTS: Cytochemical staining as well as gene expression and proteomic analysis revealed that osteogenic commitment was poor in WJ-MSC. However, stimulation of the BMP2 pathway with BMP2 plus tanshinone IIA and the addition of extracellular vesicles or protein-enriched preparations from differentiating BM-MSC enhanced WJ-MSC osteogenesis. Furthermore, greater outcome was obtained with the use of conditioned media from differentiating BM-MSC.

METHODS: In this study, to systematically evaluate the biological properties of MSCs at various passages, we analyzed biomarker expression, cell proliferation and apoptosis, chromosome karyotype, and tri-lineage differentiation potential. Subsequently, we took advantage of whole-exome sequencing to compare the somatic hypermutation of hUC-MSCs at P3, P6, and P15 including SNV and INDEL mutations. In addition, to explore the safety of the abovementioned hUC-MSCs, we performed metabolic pathway enrichment analysis and in vivo transplantation analysis. Furthermore, we cocultured the abovementioned hUC-MSCs with UCB-CD34
RESULTS: The hUC-MSCs at P3, P6, and P15 showed similar morphology, biomarker expression, and cytokine secretion. hUC-MSCs at P15 had advantages on adipogenic differentiation and some cytokine secretion such as IL-6 and VEGF, with disadvantages on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential. Based on the SNP data of 334,378 exons and bioinformatic analyses, we found the somatic point mutations could be divided into 96 subsets and formed 30 kinds of signatures but did not show correlation with risk of tumorigenesis, which was confirmed by the in vivo transplantation experiments. However, hUC-MSCs at P15 showed impaired hematologic supporting effect in vitro and declined therapeutic effect on aGVHD in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we systematically evaluated the biological and genetic properties of hUC-MSCs at various passages. Our findings have provided new references for safety and effectiveness assessments, which will provide overwhelming evidence for the safety of hUC-MSCs after continuous in vitro passages both at the cellular and molecular levels for the first time. Taken together, our studies could help understand the controversial effects of disease treatment and benefit the clinical research of UC-MSCs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Qinjun Zhao, Leisheng Zhang, Yimeng Wei, Hao Yu, Linglin Zou, Jiali Huo, Hongju Yang, Baoquan Song, Teng Wei, Dan Wu, Wenxia Zhang, Lei Zhang, Dengke Liu, Zongjin Li, Ying Chi, Zhibo Han, Zhongchao Han<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31779707">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A comparison of BMP2 delivery by coacervate and gene therapy for promoting human muscle-derived stem cell-mediated articular cartilage repair.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis and cartilage injury treatment is an unmet clinical need. Therefore, development of new approaches to treat these diseases is critically needed. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that murine muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) can efficiently repair articular cartilage in an osteochondral and osteoarthritis model. However, the cartilage repair capacity of human muscle-derived stem cells has not been studied which prompt this study.
METHOD: In this study, we tested the in vitro chondrogenesis ability of six populations of human muscle-derived stem cells (hMDSCs), before and after lenti-BMP2/GFP transduction using pellet culture and evaluated chondrogenic differentiation of via histology and Raman spectroscopy. We further compared the in vivo articular cartilage repair of hMDSCs stimulated with BMP2 delivered through coacervate sustain release technology and lenti-viral gene therapy-mediated gene delivery in a monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) model. We used microCT and histology to evaluate the cartilage repair.
RESULTS: We observed that all hMDSCs were able to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in vitro. As expected, lenti-BMP2/GFP transduction further enhanced the chondrogenic differentiation capacities of hMDSCs, as confirmed by Alcian blue and Col2A1staining as well as Raman spectroscopy analysis. We observed through micro-CT scanning, Col2A1 staining, and histological analyses that delivery of BMP2 with coacervate could achieve a similar articular cartilage repair to that mediated by hMDSC-LBMP2/GFP. We also found that the addition of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1) protein further improved the regenerative potential of hMDSCs/BMP2 delivered through the coacervate sustain release technology. Donor cells did not primarily contribute to the repaired articular cartilage since most of the repair cells are host derived as indicated by GFP staining.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the delivery of hMDSCs and BMP2 with the coacervate technology can achieve a similar cartilage repair relative to lenti-BMP2/GFP-mediated gene therapy. The use of coacervate technology to deliver BMP2/sFLT1 with hMDSCs for cartilage repair holds promise for possible clinical translation into an effective treatment modality for osteoarthritis and traumatic cartilage injury.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Xueqin Gao, Haizi Cheng, Hassan Awada, Ying Tang, Sarah Amra, Aiping Lu, Xuying Sun, Guijin Lv, Charles Huard, Bing Wang, Xiaohong Bi, Yadong Wang, Johnny Huard<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31771623">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> lncRNAs: function and mechanism in cartilage development, degeneration, and regeneration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> With the increasing incidence of cartilage-related diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), heavier financial and social burdens need to be faced. Unfortunately, there is no satisfactory clinical method to target the pathophysiology of cartilage-related diseases. Many gene expressions, signaling pathways, and biomechanical dysregulations were involved in cartilage development, degeneration, and regeneration. However, the underlying mechanism was not clearly understood. Recently, lots of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified in the biological processes, including cartilage development, degeneration, and regeneration. It is clear that lncRNAs were important in regulating gene expression and maintaining chondrocyte phenotypes and homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the recent researches studying lncRNAs' expression and function in cartilage development, degeneration, and regeneration and illustrate the potential mechanism of how they act in the pathologic process. With continued efforts, regulating lncRNA expression in the cartilage regeneration may be a promising biological treatment approach.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Jian Zhu, Wei Yu, Yitian Wang, Kaishun Xia, Yuluan Huang, Ankai Xu, Qixin Chen, Bing Liu, Huimin Tao, Fangcai Li, Chengzhen Liang<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31753016">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> An overview on small molecule-induced differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into beta cells for diabetic therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The field of regenerative medicine provides enormous opportunities for generating beta cells from different stem cell sources for cellular therapy. Even though insulin-secreting cells can be generated from a variety of stem cell types like pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells, the ideal functional cells should be generated from patients' own cells and expanded to considerable levels by non-integrative culture techniques. In terms of the ease of isolation, plasticity, and clinical translation to generate autologous cells, mesenchymal stem cell stands superior. Furthermore, small molecules offer a great advantage in terms of generating functional beta cells from stem cells. Research suggests that most of the mesenchymal stem cell-based protocols to generate pancreatic beta cells have small molecules in their cocktail. However, most of the protocols generate cells that mimic the characteristics of human beta cells, thereby generating "beta cell-like cells" as opposed to mature beta cells. Diabetic therapy becomes feasible only when there are robust, functional, and safe cells for replacing the damaged or lost beta cells. In this review, we discuss the current protocols used to generate beta cells from mesenchymal cells, with emphasis on small molecule-mediated conversion into insulin-producing beta cell-like cells. Our data and the data presented from the references within this review would suggest that although mesenchymal stem cells are an attractive cell type for cell therapy they are not readily converted into functional mature beta cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Nimshitha Pavathuparambil Abdul Manaph, Kisha N Sivanathan, Jodie Nitschke, Xin-Fu Zhou, Patrick T Coates, Christopher John Drogemuller<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547868">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Teaching an Old Molecule New Tricks: Drug Repositioning for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Libero Vitiello, Lucia Tibaudo, Elena Pegoraro, Luca Bello, Marcella Canton<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801292">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nano-Enhanced Drug Delivery and Therapeutic Ultrasound for Cancer Treatment and Beyond.<br><b>Abstract:</b> While ultrasound is most widely known for its use in diagnostic imaging, the energy carried by ultrasound waves can be utilized to influence cell function and drug delivery. Consequently, our ability to use ultrasound energy at a given intensity unlocks the opportunity to use the ultrasound for therapeutic applications. Indeed, in the last decade ultrasound-based therapies have emerged with promising treatment modalities for several medical conditions. More recently, ultrasound in combination with nanomedicines, i.e., nanoparticles, has been shown to have substantial potential to enhance the efficacy of many treatments including cancer, Alzheimer disease or osteoarthritis. The concept of ultrasound combined with drug delivery is still in its infancy and more research is needed to unfold the mechanisms and interactions of ultrasound with different nanoparticles types and with various cell types.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in CRC growth and metastasis. Recent studies revealed that lncRNAs participate in CRC progression by coordinating with microRNAs (miRNAs) and protein-coding mRNAs. LncRNAs function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) by competitively occupying the shared binding sequences of miRNAs, thus sequestering the miRNAs and changing the expression of their downstream target genes. Such ceRNA networks formed by lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA interactions have been found in a broad spectrum of biological processes in CRC, including liver metastasis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammation formation, and chemo-/radioresistance. In this review, we summarize typical paradigms of lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks, which are involved in the underlying molecular mechanisms of CRC initiation and progression. We comprehensively discuss the competitive crosstalk among RNA transcripts and the novel targets for CRC prognosis and therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Liye Wang, Kwang Bog Cho, Yan Li, Gabriel Tao, Zuoxu Xie, Bin Guo<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31744051">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Impact of Fibronectin Knockout on Proliferation and Differentiation of Human Infrapatellar Fat Pad-Derived Stem Cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Fibronectin plays an essential role in tissue development and regeneration.

Currently, no standardized technique for this preparation exists. Processing quantitative standards (PQSs) define manufacturing quantitative variables (such as time, volume, and pressure). Processing qualitative standards (PQLSs) define the quality of the materials and methods in manufacturing. The purpose of the review was to use PQSs and PQLSs to report the in vivo and in vitro results obtained by different processing kits that use different procedures (enzymatic vs. non-enzymatic) to isolate human AD-SVFs/AD-MSCs. PQSs included the volume of fat tissue harvested and reagents used, the time/gravity of centrifugation, and the time, temperature, and tilt level/speed of incubation and/or centrifugation. PQLSs included the use of a collagenase, a processing time of 30 min, kit weight, transparency of the kit components, the maintenance of a closed sterile processing environment, and the use of a small centrifuge and incubating rocker. Using a kit with the PQSs and PQLSs described in this study enables the isolation of AD-MSCs that meet the consensus quality criteria. As the discovery of new critical quality attributes (CQAs) of AD-MSCs evolve with respect to purity and potency, adjustments to these benchmark PQSs and PQLs will hopefully isolate AD-MSCs of various CQAs with greater reproducibility, quality, and safety.

It is well known that stem cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms change their internal architecture and composition in response to external physical stimuli, thanks to cells' ability to sense mechanical signals and elicit selected biological functions. Likewise, stem cells play an active role in governing the composition and the architecture of their microenvironment. Is now being documented that, thanks to this dynamic relationship, stemness identity and stem cell functions are maintained. In this work, we review the current knowledge in mechanobiology on stem cells. We start with the description of theoretical basis of mechanobiology, continue with the effects of mechanical cues on stem cells, development, pathology, and regenerative medicine, and emphasize the contribution in the field of the development of ex-vivo mechanobiology modelling and computational tools, which allow for evaluating the role of forces on stem cell biology.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Chiara Argentati, Francesco Morena, Ilaria Tortorella, Martina Bazzucchi, Serena Porcellati, Carla Emiliani, Sabata Martino<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31717803">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> PRP and BMAC for Musculoskeletal Conditions via Biomaterial Carriers.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) are orthobiologic therapies considered as an alternative to the current therapies for muscle, bone and cartilage.

This study endeavored to assess population genetics consequences of such therapies. Computer simulations were used to evaluate the heterogeneity in causal alleles for polygenic diseases that could exist among geographically distinct populations. The results show that although heterogeneity would not be easily detectable by epidemiological studies following population admixture, even significant heterogeneity would not impede the outcomes of preventive gene therapies. Preventive gene therapies designed to correct causal alleles to a naturally-occurring neutral state of nucleotides would lower the prevalence of polygenic early- to middle-age-onset diseases in proportion to the decreased population relative risk attributable to the edited alleles. The outcome would manifest differently for late-onset diseases, for which the therapies would result in a delayed disease onset and decreased lifetime risk; however, the lifetime risk would increase again with prolonging population life expectancy, which is a likely consequence of such therapies. If the preventive heritable gene therapies were to be applied on a large scale, the decreasing frequency of risk alleles in populations would reduce the disease risk or delay the age of onset, even with a fraction of the population receiving such therapies. With ongoing population admixture, all groups would benefit over generations.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Roman Teo Oliynyk<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658652">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Replication Stress at Telomeric and Mitochondrial DNA: Common Origins and Consequences on Ageing.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Senescence is defined as a stress-induced durable cell cycle arrest. We herein revisit the origin of two of these stresses, namely mitochondrial metabolic compromise, associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and replicative senescence, activated by extreme telomere shortening. We discuss how replication stress-induced DNA damage of telomeric DNA (telDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be considered a common origin of senescence in vitro, with consequences on ageing in vivo. Unexpectedly, mtDNA and telDNA share common features indicative of a high degree of replicative stress, such as G-quadruplexes, D-loops, RNA:DNA heteroduplexes, epigenetic marks, or supercoiling. To avoid these stresses, both compartments use similar enzymatic strategies involving, for instance, endonucleases, topoisomerases, helicases, or primases. Surprisingly, many of these replication helpers are active at both telDNA and mtDNA (e.g., RNAse H1, FEN1, DNA2, RecQ helicases, Top2α, Top2β, TOP3A, DNMT1/3a/3b, SIRT1). In addition, specialized telomeric proteins, such as TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) and TERC (telomerase RNA component), or TIN2 (shelterin complex), shuttle from telomeres to mitochondria, and, by doing so, modulate mitochondrial metabolism and the production of ROS, in a feedback manner. Hence, mitochondria and telomeres use common weapons and cooperate to resist/prevent replication stresses, otherwise producing common consequences, namely senescence and ageing.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Pauline Billard, Delphine A Poncet<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597307">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Lysyl Oxidase-Like 2 Protects against Progressive and Aging Related Knee Joint Osteoarthritis in Mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to determine if adenovirus-delivered LOXL2 protects against progressive knee osteoarthritis (OA), assess its specific mechanism of action; and determine if the overexpression of LOXL2 in transgenic mice can protect against the development of OA-related cartilage damage and joint disability.
METHODS: Four-month-old Cho/+ male and female mice were intraperitoneally injected with either Adv-RFP-LOXL2 or an empty vector twice a month for four months. The proteoglycan levels and the expression of anabolic and catabolic genes were examined by immunostaining and qRT-PCR. The effect of LOXL2 expression on signaling was tested via the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β in the cartilage cell line ATDC5. Finally; the OA by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) injection was also induced in transgenic mice with systemic overexpression of LOXL2 and examined gene expression and joint function by treadmill tests and assessment of allodynia.
RESULTS: The adenovirus treatment upregulated LOXL2; Sox9; Acan and Runx2 expression in both males and females. The Adv-RFP-LOXL2 injection; but not the empty vector injection increased proteoglycan staining and aggrecan expression but reduced MMP13 expression. LOXL2 attenuated IL-1β-induced phospho-NF-κB/p65 and rescued chondrogenic lineage-related genes in ATDC5 cells; demonstrating one potential protective mechanism. LOXL2 attenuated phospho-NF-κB independent of its enzymatic activity. Finally; LOXL2-overexpressing transgenic mice were protected from MIA-induced OA-related functional changes; including the time and distance traveled on the treadmill and allodynia.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that systemic LOXL2 adenovirus or LOXL2 genetic overexpression in mice can protect against OA.

These advances will be critical to establish the scientific platform from which future Klotho-based interventional trials and therapeutic enterprises can be successfully launched.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Lim, Arvin Halim, Tzong-Shi Lu, Alan Ashworth, Irene Chong<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546756">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Proteomic Analysis in Morquio A Cells Treated with Immobilized Enzymatic Replacement Therapy on Nanostructured Lipid Systems.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Morquio A syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA), is a lysosomal storage disease due to mutations in the N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-21<br><b>Authors:</b> J Víctor Álvarez, Susana B Bravo, María García-Vence, María J De Castro, Asteria Luzardo, Cristóbal Colón, Shunji Tomatsu, Francisco J Otero-Espinar, María L Couce<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540344">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Inflammatory processes and elevated osteoclast activity chaperon atrophic non-union establishment in a murine model.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Delayed bone healing, especially in long bones poses one of the biggest problems in orthopeadic and reconstructive surgery and causes tremendous costs every year. There is a need for exploring the causes in order to find an adequate therapy. Earlier investigations of human scaphoid non-union revealed an elevated osteoclast activity, accompanied by upregulated levels of TGF-beta and RANKL. Interestingly, scaphoid non-union seemed to be well vascularized.
METHODS: In the current study, we used a murine femur-defect model to study atrophic non unions over a time-course of 10 weeks. Different time points were chosen, to gather insights into the dynamic processes of non-union establishment.
RESULTS: Histological analyses as well as western blots and qRT-PCR indicated enhanced osteoclast activity throughout the observation period, paralleled by elevated levels of TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, MMP9, MMP13 and RANKL, especially during the early phases of non-union establishment. Interestingly, elevated levels of these mediators decreased markedly over a period of 10 weeks, as inflammatory reaction during non-union establishment seemed to wear out. To our surprise, osteoblastogenesis seemed to be unaffected during early stages of non-union establishment.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, we gained first insights into the establishment process of atrophic non unions, in which inflammatory processes accompanied by highly elevated osteoclast activity seem to play a leading role.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Johannes M Wagner, Sonja V Schmidt, Mehran Dadras, Julika Huber, Christoph Wallner, Stephanie Dittfeld, Mustafa Becerikli, Henriette Jaurich, Felix Reinkemeier, Marius Drysch, Marcus Lehnhardt, Björn Behr<br><b>Journal:</b> J Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1479-5876<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.20<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.591<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831031">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> High Prevalence of Integrative and Conjugative Elements Encoding Transcription Activator-Like Effector Repeats in <br><b>Abstract:</b> Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are modular mobile genetic elements that can disseminate through excision, circularization, and transfer.

Distinct expression levels of miRNAs, including miR-29b, have been detected in various biological fluids and tissues from a large variety of disease models. However, how miRNAs "react" and function in different cellular environments is still largely unknown. In this study, the regulation patterns of miR-29b between human and mouse cell lines were compared for the first time. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to stably knockdown miR-29b in human cancer HeLa cells and mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells with minimum off-targets. Genome editing revealed mir-29b-1, other than mir-29b-2, to be the main source of generating mature miR-29b. The editing of miR-29b decreased expression levels of its family members miR-29a/c via changing the tertiary structures of surrounding nucleotides. Comparing transcriptome profiles of human and mouse cell lines, miR-29b displayed common regulation pathways involving distinct downstream targets in macromolecular complex assembly, cell cycle regulation, and Wnt and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways; miR-29b also demonstrated specific functions reflecting cell characteristics, including fibrosis and neuronal regulations in NIH/3T3 cells and tumorigenesis and cellular senescence in HeLa cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Wenting Zhao, Lesley Cheng, Camelia Quek, Shayne A Bellingham, Andrew F Hill<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767948">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Male mice lacking ADAMTS-16 are fertile but exhibit testes of reduced weight.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Adamts16 encodes a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs, 16, a member of a family of multi-domain, zinc-binding proteinases. ADAMTS-16 is implicated in a number of pathological conditions, including hypertension, cancer and osteoarthritis. A large number of observations, including a recent report of human ADAMTS16 variants in cases of 46,XY disorders/differences of sex development (DSD), also implicate this gene in human testis determination. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate a loss-of-function allele in the mouse in order to examine whether ADAMTS-16 functions in mouse testis determination or testicular function. Male mice lacking Adamts16 on the C57BL/6N background undergo normal testis determination in the fetal period. However, adult homozygotes have an average testis weight that is around 10% lower than age-matched controls. Cohorts of mutant males tested at 3-months and 6-months of age were fertile.

Given the heterogeneity of responses of different muscles to disease, we set out to characterize the PC in wild-type and muscular dystrophic mdx mice. The mouse PC contained mainly fast-twitch type IIB myofibers showing body wide distribution. The PC exemplified heterogeneity in myofiber sizes and a prevalence of central nucleated fibres (CNFs), hallmarks of regeneration, in wild-type and mdx muscles, which increased with age. PC myofibers were hypertrophic in mdx compared to wild-type mice. Sexual dimorphism was apparent with a two-fold increase in CNFs in PC from male versus female mdx mice. To evaluate myogenic potential, PC muscle progenitors were isolated from 8-week old wild-type and mdx mice, grown and differentiated for 7-days. Myogenic profiling of PC-derived myocytes suggested that male mdx satellite cells (SCs) were more myogenic than female counterparts, independent of SC density in PC muscles. Muscle regenerative differences in the PC were associated with alterations in expression of calcium handling regulatory proteins. These studies highlight unique aspects of the PC muscle and its potential as a model to study mechanisms of striated muscle regeneration in health and disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Ola A Bahri, Neia Naldaiz-Gastesi, Donna C Kennedy, Antony M Wheatley, Ander Izeta, Karl J A McCullagh<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685850">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Chronic kidney disease exacerbates ischemic limb myopathy in mice via altered mitochondrial energetics.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Chronic kidney disease (CKD) substantially increases the severity of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) symptomology, however, the biological mechanisms remain unclear.

However, allogeneic cell therapy is limited by host patient immunologic competence and inconsistent performance due to cell delivery methods. To address allogeneic cell therapy limitations, this study developed a new allogeneic stem cell sheet using human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) that present low antigenicity (i.e., major histocompatibility complex, MHC). Optimal conditions including cell density, passage number, and culture time were examined to fabricate reliable hUC-MSC sheets. MHC II antigens correlated to alloimmune rejection were barely expressed in hUC-MSC sheets compared to other comparator MSC sheets (hBMSC and hADSC). hUC-MSC sheets easily graft spontaneously onto subcutaneous tissue in immune-deficient mice within 10 minutes of placement. No sutures are required to secure sheets to tissue because sheet extracellular matrix (ECM) actively facilitates cell-target tissue adhesion. At 10 days post-transplantation, hUC-MSC sheets remain on ectopic target tissue sites and exhibit new blood vessel formation. Furthermore, implanted hUC-MSC sheets secrete human HGF continuously to the murine target tissue. hUC-MSC sheets described here should provide new insights for improving allogenic cell-based therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Kyungsook Kim, Sophia Bou-Ghannam, Hallie Thorp, David W Grainger, Teruo Okano<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595012">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> HyPer2 imaging reveals temporal and heterogeneous hydrogen peroxide changes in denervated and aged skeletal muscle fibers in vivo.<br><b>Abstract:</b> To determine the role of denervation and motor unit turnover in the age-related increase in skeletal muscle oxidative stress, the hydrogen peroxide (H<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-08<br><b>Authors:</b> C A Staunton, E D Owen, N Pollock, A Vasilaki, R Barrett-Jolley, A McArdle, M J Jackson<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595023">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cell Therapy: Effect of Locally Injected Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Derived from Bone Marrow or Adipose Tissue on Bone Regeneration of Rat Calvarial Defects.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Treatment of large bone defects is a challenging clinical situation that may be benefited from cell therapies based on regenerative medicine. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of local injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) or adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) on the regeneration of rat calvarial defects. BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs were characterized based on their expression of specific surface markers; cell viability was evaluated after injection with a 21-G needle. Defects measuring 5 mm that were created in rat calvaria were injected with BM-MSCs, AT-MSCs, or vehicle-phosphate-buffered saline (Control) 2 weeks post-defect creation. Cells were tracked by bioluminescence, and 4 weeks post-injection, the newly formed bone was evaluated by µCT, histology, nanoindentation, and gene expression of bone markers. BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs exhibited the characteristics of MSCs and maintained their viability after passing through the 21-G needle. Injection of both BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs resulted in increased bone formation compared to that in Control and with similar mechanical properties as those of native bone. The expression of genes associated with bone formation was higher in the newly formed bone induced by BM-MSCs, whereas the expression of genes involved in bone resorption was higher in the AT-MSC group. Cell therapy based on local injection of BM-MSCs or AT-MSCs is effective in delivering cells that induced a significant improvement in bone healing. Despite differences observed in molecular cues between BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs, both cells had the ability to induce bone tissue formation at comparable amounts and properties. These results may drive new cell therapy approaches toward complete bone regeneration.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Gileade P Freitas, Helena B Lopes, Alann T P Souza, Paula G F P Oliveira, Adriana L G Almeida, Lucas E B Souza, Paulo G Coelho, Marcio M Beloti, Adalberto L Rosa<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530883">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles for Therapeutic Applications in Bone Regeneration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Bone injuries and diseases constitute a burden both socially and economically, as the consequences of a lack of effective treatments affect both the patients' quality of life and the costs on the health systems. This impended need has led the research community's efforts to establish efficacious bone tissue engineering solutions. There has been a recent focus on the use of biomaterial-based nanoparticles for the delivery of therapeutic factors. Among the biomaterials being considered to date, calcium phosphates have emerged as one of the most promising materials for bone repair applications due to their osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity and their ability to be resorbed in the body. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have received particular attention as non-viral vectors for gene therapy, as factors such as plasmid DNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) and silencing RNA (siRNAs) can be easily incorporated on their surface. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles loaded with therapeutic factors have also been delivered to the site of bone injury using scaffolds and hydrogels.

Developments in genetic diagnosis, molecular techniques and treatment technologies however, are leading to unparalleled therapeutic advance. This review explores the evolving therapeutic landscape of genetic skeletal disorders (GSDs); the key conditions and there key differentials.
METHODS: A retrospective literature based review was conducted in December 2018 using a systematic search strategy for relevant articles and trials in Pubmed and clinicaltrials.gov respectively. Over 140 articles and 80 trials were generated for review.
RESULTS: Over 20 personalised therapies are discussed in addition to several novel disease modifying treatments in over 25 GSDs. Treatments discussed are at different stages from preclinical studies to clinical trials and approved drugs, including; Burosumab for X-linked hypophosphatemia, Palovarotene for Hereditary Multiple Exostoses, Carbamazepine for Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia (Schmid type), Lithium carbonate and anti-sclerostin therapy for Osteoporosis Pseudoglioma syndrome and novel therapies for Osteopetrosis. We also discuss therapeutic advances in Achondroplasia, Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), Hypophosphotasia (HPP), Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, and RNA silencing therapies in preclinical studies for OI and HPP.
DISCUSSION: It is an exciting time for GSD therapies despite the challenges of drug development in rare diseases. In discussing emerging therapies, we explore novel approaches to drug development from drug repurposing to in-utero stem cell transplants.

Molecular changes in HCC collectively contribute to Wnt/β-catenin, as a tumor proliferative signaling pathway, toll-like receptors (TLRs), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), as well as the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), predominant signaling pathways linked to the release of tumor-promoting cytokines. It should also be noted that the Hippo signaling pathway plays an important role in organ size control, particularly in promoting tumorigenesis and HCC development. Nowadays, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-based therapies have been the subject of in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies for liver such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and HCC. At present, despite the importance of basic molecular pathways of malignancies, limited information has been obtained on this background. Therefore, it can be difficult to determine the true concept of interactions between MSCs and tumor cells. What is known, these cells could migrate toward tumor sites so apply effects via paracrine interaction on HCC cells. For example, one of the inhibitory effects of MSCs is the overexpression of dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1) as an important antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway.

VPAC receptors seem to preferentially interact with Gs in inflammatory cells, rather than Gq, thereby stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. cAMP is able to trigger various downstream pathways, mainly the canonical PKA pathway and the non-canonical cAMP-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (EPAC) pathway. Classically, the presence of VPACs has been confined to the plasma membrane; however, VPAC1 location has been described in the nuclear membrane in several cell types such as activated Th cells, where they are also functional. VPAC receptor signaling modulates a number of biological processes by tipping the balance of inflammatory mediators in macrophages and other innate immune cells, modifying the expression of TLRs, and inhibiting MMPs and the expression of adhesion molecules. Receptor signaling also downregulates coagulation factors and acute-phase proteins, promotes Th2 over Th1, stimulates Treg abundance, and finally inhibits a pathogenic Th17 profile. Thus, the VIP axis signaling regulates both the innate and adaptive immune responses in several inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease that develops on a substrate of genetically susceptible individuals and under the influence of environmental factors, as well as epigenetic mechanisms. It is a heterogeneous disease with different pathogenic mechanisms and variable clinical forms between patients with the same diagnosis.

However, whether it represents a suitable cell source for regenerative approaches, both in the inflamed and non-inflamed states, remains unclear. In the present study, inflamed and native human LHBs were comparatively characterized for features of regeneration.
Methods: In total, 22 resected LHB tendons were classified into inflamed samples (n = 11) and non-inflamed samples (n = 11). Proliferation potential and specific marker gene expression of primary LHB-derived cell cultures were analyzed. Multipotentiality, including osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and tenogenic differentiation potential of both groups were compared under respective lineage-specific culture conditions.
Results: Inflammation does not seem to affect the proliferation rate of the isolated tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) and the tenogenic marker gene expression. Cells from both groups showed an equivalent osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic and tenogenic differentiation potential in histology and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the LHB tendon might be a suitable cell source for regenerative approaches, both in inflamed and non-inflamed states. The LHB with and without tendinitis has been characterized as a novel source of TDSCs, which might facilitate treatment of degeneration and induction of regeneration in shoulder surgery.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-07<br><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Schmalzl, Piet Plumhoff, Fabian Gilbert, Frank Gohlke, Christian Konrads, Ulrich Brunner, Franz Jakob, Regina Ebert, Andre F Steinert<br><b>Journal:</b> Bone Joint Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2046-3758<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.55<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.597<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588358">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Editorial focus: understanding off-target effects as the key to successful RNAi therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> With the first RNA interference (RNAi) drug (ONPATTRO (patisiran)) on the market, we witness the RNAi therapy field reaching a critical turning point, when further improvements in drug candidate design and delivery pipelines should enable fast delivery of novel life changing treatments to patients.

On the other hand, the fate transformation of terminally differentiated cells is a consequence of erroneous development, and ultimately leads to cancer. In this review, we elaborate how development and cancer share several biological processes, including molecular controls. Transcription factors (TF) are at the helm of both these processes, among many others, and are evolutionarily conserved, ranging from yeast to humans. Here, we discuss four families of TFs that play a pivotal role and have been studied extensively in both embryonic development and cancer-high mobility group box (HMG), GATA, paired box (PAX) and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) in the context of their role in development, cancer, and their conservation across several species. Finally, we review TFs as possible therapeutic targets for cancer and reflect on the importance of natural resistance against cancer in certain organisms, yielding knowledge regarding TF function and cancer biology.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Huilgol, Prabhadevi Venkataramani, Saikat Nandi, Sonali Bhattacharjee<br><b>Journal:</b> Genes (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4425<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.43<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.592<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614829">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dissecting the Role of NF-κb Protein Family and Its Regulators in Rheumatoid Arthritis Using Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic synovial autoinflammatory disease that destructs the cartilage and bone, leading to disability.

These molecules play critical roles from embryogenesis to adult stages; therefore, alterations such as abnormal expression or mutations of the genes involved and their downstream factors cause a variety of genetic disorders at different stages. The Hh family involves many signaling mediators and functions through complex mechanisms, and achieving a comprehensive understanding of the entire signaling system is challenging. This review discusses the signaling mediators of the Hh pathway and their functions at the cellular and organismal levels. We first focus on the roles of Hh signaling mediators in signal transduction at the cellular level and the networks formed by these factors. Then, we analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of expression of Hh pathway molecules in tissues and organs, and describe the phenotypes of mutant mice. Finally, we discuss the genetic disorders caused by malfunction of Hh signaling-related molecules in humans.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Noriaki Sasai, Michinori Toriyama, Toru Kondo<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-8021<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.888<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781166">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genetic Pathways of Aging and Their Relevance in the Dog as a Natural Model of Human Aging.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Aging research has experienced a burst of scientific efforts in the last decades as the growing ratio of elderly people has begun to pose an increased burden on the healthcare and pension systems of developed countries.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BBD on obesity-induced NAFLD.
Methods: C57BL/6 J mice were fed with normal diet, high fat diet (HFD) or HFD + BBD for 8 weeks. Weights of all mice were recorded every 3 days. At the end of the experiments, the level of livers, kidneys and adipose tissues of each animal was weighed. Blood serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glucose and leptin were detected with appropriate test kits. Haematoxylin-eosin (HE), Masson trichrome and Oil Red O staining of the liver were performed. We applied immunohistochemical analysis to investigate the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and leptin in liver tissue. The expression of genes related lipid anabolism (SREBP1-c, ACC, SCD-1, LXRα and CD36) and ß-oxidation (CPT-1 and PPARα) in liver and adipose tissues was determined by RT-PCR. The expression of AMPK and p-AMPK was determined by western blot analysis.
Results: We found the weight of bodies and tissues (retroperitoneal fat pads, kidneys and livers) of mice fed with HFD + BBD were significantly lower than that of HFD-fed mice. And liver injury induced by HFD was relieved in mice treated with BBD, accompanied with significant reduction were observed in serum ALT/AST activities and alleviated pathological damage. The levels of glucose, TG, TC, HDL-C and LDL-C in the liver or serum were significantly decreased on HFD + BBD group compared with HFD group. Furthermore, BBD treatment reduced the level of TNF-α and IL-6 induced by HFD. The level of leptin in the liver and serum were reduced in mice fed with HFD + BBD than that of HFD-fed mice. Several lipid synthesis genes (SREBP1-c, ACC, SCD-1, LXRα and CD36) were down-regulated and that of ß-oxidation (CPT-1 and PPARα) up-regulated in HFD + BBD group compared with HFD group. In addition, BBD increased the expression of p-AMPK compared with untreated HFD group, which suggested BBD improved the activation of AMPK pathway.
Conclusion: In summary, our results indicate that BBD has potential applications in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD, which may be closely related to its effect on lipid metabolism via activation of AMPK signaling.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Dandan Sheng, Shanmin Zhao, Lu Gao, Huifei Zheng, Wenting Liu, Jing Hou, Yuxiang Jin, Fei Ye, Qiudong Zhao, Rong Li, Naping Zhao, Li Zhang, Zhipeng Han, Lixin Wei<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Biosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-3701<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.34<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.303<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548878">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> RhoA/ROCK pathway: implication in osteoarthritis and therapeutic targets.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) and its downstream effector Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) play important roles in multiple cellular processes, but abnormal activation of this pathway have been reported to be involved in various types of diseases, including osteoarthritis (OA). This article focused to review the RhoA/ROCK association and its functional role in OA development, and possible therapeutics of OA by targeting this pathway. We have explored the databases like Pubmed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and SCOPUS, and collected the papers on Rho/ROCK and their relationship with OA, and reviewed comprehensively. Studies revealed that the abnormal activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling is involved in early phase response to abnormal mechanical stimuli, which is thought to be a contributory factor to OA progression. RhoA/ROCK interacts with OA pathological factors and induces cartilage degeneration through the degradation of chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM). As the RhoA/ROCK activity can affect bone formation by triggering cartilage degradation, it may represent a possible therapeutic target to treat OA. Interestingly, several pharmaceutical companies are investing in the development of RhoA/ROCK inhibitors for the treatment of OA. However, a few in vivo experiments have been successfully conducted to demonstrate the potential value of RhoA/ROCK pathway inhibition in the treatment of OA. This review provides an insight into the functional role of Rho/ROCK pathway, and indicates that targeting this pathway might be promising in future OA treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhan Deng, Yiming Jia, Haifeng Liu, Miao He, Yuntao Yang, Wenfeng Xiao, Yusheng Li<br><b>Journal:</b> Am J Transl Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1943-8141<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.24<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.966<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632513">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Crosstalk Between Osteodifferentiating Stem Cells and Endothelial Cells Promotes Angiogenesis and Bone Formation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The synergistic crosstalk between osteodifferentiating stem cells and endothelial cells (ECs) gained the deserved consideration, shedding light on the role of angiogenesis for bone formation and healing. A deep understanding of the molecular basis underlying the mutual influence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and ECs in the osteogenic process may help improve greatly bone regeneration. Here, the authors demonstrated that osteodifferentiating MSCs co-cultured with ECs promote angiogenesis and ECs recruitment. Moreover, through the use of 3D co-culture systems, we showed that ECs are in turn able to further stimulate the osteodifferentiation of MSCs, thus enhancing bone production. These findings highlighted the existence of a virtuous loop between MSCs and ECs that is central to the osteogenic process.

There are many challenges for tissue cartilage repair. However, 3D bio-printing of osteochondral scaffolds provides a promising solution. This study involved preparing bio-inks with different proportions of chitosan (Cs), Gelatin (Gel), and Hyaluronic acid (HA). The rheological properties of each bio-ink was used to identify the optimal bio-ink for printing. To improve the mechanical properties of the bio-scaffold, Graphene (GR) with a mass ratio of 0.024, 0.06, and 0.1% was doped in the bio-ink. Bio-scaffolds were prepared using 3D printing technology. The mechanical strength, water absorption rate, porosity, and degradation rate of the bio-scaffolds were compared to select the most suitable scaffold to support the proliferation and differentiation of cells. P3 Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were inoculated onto the bio-scaffolds to study the biocompatibility of the scaffolds. The results of SEM showed that the Cs/Gel/HA scaffolds with a GR content of 0, 0.024, 0.06, and 0.1% had a good three-dimensional porous structure and interpenetrating pores, and a porosity of more than 80%. GR was evenly distributed on the scaffold as observed by energy spectrum analyzer and polarizing microscope. With increasing GR content, the mechanical strength of the scaffold was enhanced, and pore walls became thicker and smoother. BMSCs were inoculated on the different scaffolds. The cells distributed and extended well on Cs/Gel/HA/GR scaffolds. Compared to traditional methods in tissue-engineering, this technique displays important advantages in simulating natural cartilage with the ability to finely control the mechanical and chemical properties of the scaffold to support cell distribution and proliferation for tissue repair.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-02<br><b>Authors:</b> Xueyan Hu, Yuan Man, Wenfang Li, Liying Li, Jie Xu, Roxanne Parungao, Yiwei Wang, Shuangshuang Zheng, Yi Nie, Tianqing Liu, Kedong Song<br><b>Journal:</b> Polymers (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4360<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.13<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.724<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574999">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> TCF-4 Regulated lncRNA-XIST Promotes M2 Polarization Of Macrophages And Is Associated With Lung Cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Little is known about the biological function of long non-coding RNA X inactive specific transcript (lncRNA XIST) and its underlying mechanism in tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization of lung cancer.

Disruption of TLR signaling at early stages of arthritis might thereby provide an opportunity to halt the disease progression and ameliorate outcomes. We previously found that Gö6976 inhibits TLR-mediated cytokine production in human and mouse macrophages by inhibiting TLR-dependent activation of protein kinase D1 (PKD1), and that PKD1 is essential for proinflammatory responses mediated by MyD88-dependent TLRs. In this study, we investigated whether PKD1 contributes to TLR-mediated proinflammatory responses in human synovial cells, and whether Gö6976 treatment can suppress the development and progression of type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in mouse. We found that TLR/IL-1R ligands induced activation of PKD1 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS). TLR/IL-1R-induced expression of cytokines/chemokines was substantially inhibited in Gö6976-treated HFLS and PKD1-knockdown HFLS. In addition, serum levels of anti-CII IgG antibodies, and the incidence and severity of arthritis after CII immunization were significantly reduced in mice treated daily with Gö6976. Synergistic effects of T-cell receptor and TLR, as well as TLR alone, on spleen cell proliferation and cytokine production were significantly inhibited in the presence of Gö6976. Our results suggest a possibility that ameliorating effects of Gö6976 on CIA may be due to its ability to inhibit TLR/IL-1R-activated PKD1, which might play an important role in proinflammatory responses in arthritis, and that PKD1 could be a therapeutic target for inflammatory arthritis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Tae Won Yoon, Young-In Kim, Hongsik Cho, David D Brand, Edward F Rosloniec, Linda K Myers, Arnold E Postlethwaite, Karen A Hasty, John M Stuart, Ae-Kyung Yi<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31809526">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Blood type and breed-associated differences in cell marker expression on equine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells including major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: As the search for an immune privileged allogeneic donor mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) line continues in equine medicine, the characterization of the cells between different sources becomes important. Our research seeks to more clearly define the MSC marker expression of different equine MSC donors.
METHODS: The bone marrow-derived MSCs from two equine breeds and different blood donor-types were compared over successive culture passages to determine the differential expression of important antigens. Eighteen Thoroughbreds and 18 Standardbreds, including 8 blood donor (erythrocyte Aa, Ca, and Qa antigen negative) horses, were evaluated. Bone marrow was taken from each horse for isolation and culture of MSCs. Samples from passages 2, 4, 6, and 8 were labelled and evaluated by flow cytometry. The cell surface expression of CD11a/18, CD44, CD90 and MHC class II antigens were assessed. Trilineage assays for differentiation into adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lines were performed to verify characterization of the cells as MSCs.
FINDINGS: There were significant differences in mesenchymal stem cell marker expression between breeds and blood antigen-type groups over time. Standardbred horses showed a significantly lower expression of MHC class II than did Thoroughbred horses at passages 2, 4 and 6. CD90 was significantly higher in universal blood donor Standardbreds as compared to non-blood donor Standardbreds over all time points. All MSC samples showed high expression of CD44 and low expression of CD11a/18.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal blood donor- type Standardbred MSCs from passages 2-4 show the most ideal antigen expression pattern of the horses and passages that we characterized for use as a single treatment of donor bone marrow-derived MSCs. Further work is needed to determine the significance of this differential expression along with the effect of the expression of MHC I on equine bone marrow-derived MSCs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> J Lacy Kamm, Natalie A Parlane, Christopher B Riley, Erica K Gee, Keren E Dittmer, C Wayne McIlwraith<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31747418">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Roles of leptin in the recovery of muscle and bone by reloading after mechanical unloading in high fat diet-fed obese mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Muscle and bone masses are elevated by the increased mechanical stress associated with body weight gain in obesity. However, the mechanisms by which obesity affects muscle and bone remain unclear. We herein investigated the roles of obesity and humoral factors from adipose tissue in the recovery phase after reloading from disuse-induced muscle wasting and bone loss using normal diet (ND)- or high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice with hindlimb unloading (HU) and subsequent reloading. Obesity did not affect decreases in trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), muscle mass in the lower leg, or grip strength in HU mice. Obesity significantly increased trabecular BMD, muscle mass in the lower leg, and grip strength in reloading mice over those in reloading mice fed ND. Among the humoral factors in epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue, leptin mRNA levels were significantly higher in reloading mice fed HFD than in mice fed ND. Moreover, circulating leptin levels were significantly higher in reloading mice fed HFD than in mice fed ND. Leptin mRNA levels in epididymal adipose tissue or serum leptin levels positively correlated with the increases in trabecular BMD, total muscle mass, and grip strength in reloading mice fed ND and HFD. The present study is the first to demonstrate that obesity enhances the recovery of bone and muscle masses as well as strength decreased by disuse after reloading in mice. Leptin may contribute to the recovery of muscle and bone enhanced by obesity in mice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Naoyuki Kawao, Masayoshi Ishida, Hiroshi Kaji<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648235">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> miR-365 inhibits duck myoblast proliferation by targeting IGF-I via PI3K/Akt pathway.<br><b>Abstract:</b> miR-365 is found to be involved in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.

To uncover the mechanism by which miR-365 inhibits duck myoblast proliferation, we showed that miR-365 can down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) by directly targeting its 3'untranslated region (UTR).

The human chondrocyte cell line CHON-001, derived from normal human articular cartilage, has been widely used in vitro in osteoarthritis models. In order to better understand the underlying mechanism of OA pathogenesis, this study was conducted to explore the effects of LncRNA dynamin 3 opposite strand (DNM3OS) on CHON-001 cells.
METHODS: The expression levels of and correlation between DNM3OS and miR-126 that derived from OA and non-OA tissues were determined by quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR and Spearman's correlation analysis. Cell viability, clone, migration, invasion and apoptosis were respectively determined by cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound healing assay, transwell and flow cytometry. The target genes were predicted by starbase V2 and targetscan 7.2 and confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The expressions of apoptosis-related factors were detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: The expression of DNM3OS was down-regulated in OA patients. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of DNM3OS promoted the proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of CHON-001 cells, and that knocking down DNM3OS suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigation revealed that DNM3OS physically bound to the promoter of miR-126 and suppressed miR-126 expression. Decreased expression of DNM3OS was negatively correlated with miR-126 in OA patients. Furthermore, the effects of siDNM3OS on inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis were partially reversed by miR-126 inhibitor. Meanwhile, type insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) was identified as a target gene for miR-126 and was negatively associated with the miR-126 expression. Overexpressed IGF1 restored the effects of miR-126 mimic in suppressing cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that DNM3OS could affect the CHON-001 cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating IGF1 by sponging miR-126.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Di Ai, Fang Yu<br><b>Journal:</b> Diagn Pathol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1746-1596<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.32<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.804<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526393">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Aloe Vera/Collagen Mixture Induces Integrin α1β1 and PECAM-1 Genes Expression in Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Faraz Sigaroodi, Hajar Shafaei, Mohammad Karimipour, Mohammad Amin Dolatkhah, Abbas Delazar<br><b>Journal:</b> Adv Pharm Bull<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2228-5881<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.31<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.583<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31857972">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Current Trends in the Evaluation of Osteochondral Lesion Treatments: Histology, Histomorphometry, and Biomechanics in Preclinical Models.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Osteochondral lesions (OCs) are typically of traumatic origins but are also caused by degenerative conditions, in primis osteoarthritis (OA). On the other side, OC lesions themselves, getting worse over time, can lead to OA, indicating that chondral and OC defects represent a risk factor for the onset of the pathology. Many animal models have been set up for years for the study of OC regeneration, being successfully employed to test different treatment strategies, from biomaterials and cells to physical and biological adjuvant therapies. These studies rely on a plethora of post-explant investigations ranging from histological and histomorphometric analyses to biomechanical ones. The present review aims to analyze the methods employed for the evaluation of OC treatments in each animal model by screening literature data within the last 10 years. According to the selected research criteria performed in two databases, 60 works were included. Data revealed that lapine (50% of studies) and ovine (23% of studies) models are predominant, and knee joints are the most used anatomical locations for creating OC defects. Analyses are mostly conducted on paraffin-embedded samples in order to perform histological/histomorphometric analyses by applying semiquantitative scoring systems and on fresh samples in order to perform biomechanical investigations by indentation tests on articular cartilage. Instead, a great heterogeneity is pointed out in terms of OC defect dimensions and animal's age. The choice of experimental times is generally adequate for the animal models adopted, although few studies adopt very long experimental times. Improvements in data reporting and in standardization of protocols would be desirable for a better comparison of results and for ethical reasons related to appropriate and successful animal experimentation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> M Maglio, S Brogini, S Pagani, G Giavaresi, M Tschon<br><b>Journal:</b> Biomed Res Int<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2314-6141<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.14<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.795<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687388">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Long Non-Coding RNA (LncRNA) UFC1/miR-34a Contributes to Proliferation and Migration in Breast Cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND At present, a number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been realized as the critical regulators of breast cancers. Current evidence indicates that dysregulation of UFC1 contributes to the tumorigenesis and progression of various types of human cancer. However, the roles of UFC1 in breast cancer are still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS Firstly, we measured the expression of UFC1 in breast cancer tissues and cells lines compared with corresponding controls. Then, cell functional assays were performed to determine the roles of UFC1 in breast cancer progression in vitro. Moreover, the correlation between UFC1 and miR-34a was determined by luciferase reporter assays. Further, the role of miR-34a in regulating biological function of breast cancer and its downstream target CXCL10 was applied by a series of functional assays. RESULTS In present study, we found that UFC1 was highly expressed in breast tissue and cells lines compared with normal tissues and cell lines. Silenced UFC1 suppressed multiple biological activities of breast cancer cells, which also functioned as a miR-34a sponge in breast cancer. Furthermore, over-expressing miR-34a could prominently suppress cell growth, invasion, migration and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition, we verified that miR-34a was a target of CXCL10 by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS LncRNA UFC1 regulated biological activity of breast cancer via miR-34a/CXCL10 axis, providing a novel diagnosis biomarker and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Ruilian Xie, Maoyuan Wang, Wenting Zhou, Dan Wang, Yan Yuan, Huaqiu Shi, Longqiu Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> Med.

A total of 30 mature male rabbits were divided into 3 groups (10 rabbits per group). Group 1 received uncoated sutures, group 2 received sodium acetate-coated sutures, and group 3 received PRP-coated sutures. Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, USA), size 4-0 was used in all groups. Five rabbits of each group were euthanized on day 3 following the surgery while the remaining 5 rabbits were euthanized on day 10. Gross evaluation of the anastomotic site in PRP-coated sutures group demonstrated significantly (P < 0.05) lower adhesion formation scores on both days 3 and 10 of the study while in the control groups, evidence of leakage at the anastomotic site was present along with signs of haemorrhage and local inflammation. On day 10 in the control groups, there were strands of strong adhesions between the ileum, colon and cecum with large amount of fibrin deposited at the site of the anastomosis. Tissues of the anastomotic site revealed a significant level of hydroxyproline on day 10 in PRP-coated sutures group compared with control groups. Histopathological evaluation revealed significantly (P < 0.05) less inflammatory infiltration, and more angiogenesis and collagen deposition on day 10 in PRP-coated sutures group compared to the control groups.

The present study investigated the effects of miR-448 on the progression of neuropathic pain in a rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to detect the gene expression. The paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) were used to assess the pain threshold. The protein expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected by ELISA. The target of miR-448 was predicted by TargetScan software. The Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA were used to identify statistical differences among groups. miR-448 was persistently upregulated in CCI rats, and both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in CCI rats were decreased following miR-448 downregulation. The expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly increased in CCI rats compared with controls, and these effects were reversed following treatment with a miR-448 inhibitor. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was a target gene of miR-448. SIRT1 was found to abrogate the effect of miR-448 on neuropathic pain development. Collectively, the results of the present study revealed that miR-448 promoted neuropathic pain in CCI rats by regulating neuroinflammation via SIRT1. Therefore, SIRT1 may be considered as a novel biomarker for neuropathic pain.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Yunchao Chu, Weipeng Ge, Xin Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> Exp Ther Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1792-0981<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.49<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.488<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31807151">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MicroRNA-30a regulates chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells through targeting Sox9.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cartilage injury is difficult to repair since the cartilage tissue lacks self-restoration ability.

ACL injury has a marked effect on daily activities, causing pain, dysfunction, and elevated healthcare costs. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is the standard treatment for this injury. However, despite good results, ACLR is associated with a significant rate of failure. In this context, the mechanical and biological causes must be considered. From a biological perspective, the ACLR depends on the osseointegration of the graft in the adjacent bone and the process of intra-articular ligamentization for good results. Here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the normal graft healing process after ACLR and its biological modulation, thus, presenting novel strategies for biological enhancements of the ACL graft. <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Chilan Bou Ghosson Leite, Marco Kawamura Demange<br><b>Journal:</b> Acta Ortop Bras<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1413-7852<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.64<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.317<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798325">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Clinical, Pathological, and Ethical Considerations for the Conduct of Clinical Trials in Dogs with Naturally Occurring Cancer: A Comparative Approach to Accelerate Translational Drug Development.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The role of comparative oncology in translational research is receiving increasing attention from drug developers and the greater biomedical research community. Pet dogs with spontaneous cancer are important and underutilized translational models, owing to dogs' large size and relative outbreeding, combined with their high incidence of certain tumor histotypes with significant biological, genetic, and histological similarities to their human tumor counterparts. Dogs with spontaneous tumors naturally develop therapy resistance and spontaneous metastasis, all in the context of an intact immune system. These fundamental features of cancer biology are often lacking in induced or genetically engineered preclinical tumor models and likely contribute to their poor predictive value and the associated overall high failure rate in oncology drug development. Thus, the conduct of clinical trials in pet dogs with naturally occurring cancer represents a viable surrogate and valuable intermediary step that should be increasingly incorporated into the cancer drug discovery and development pipeline. The development of molecular-targeted therapies has resulted in an expanded role of the pathologist in human oncology trials, and similarly the expertise of veterinary pathologists will be increasingly valuable to all phases of comparative oncology trial design and conduct. In this review, we provide a framework of clinical, ethical, and pathology-focused considerations for the increasing integration of translational research investigations in dogs with spontaneous cancer as a means to accelerate clinical cancer discovery and drug development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-01-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Regan, Kelly Garcia, Douglas Thamm<br><b>Journal:</b> ILAR J<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1930-6180<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668709">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Autologous Microfragmented Adipose Tissue Reduces the Catabolic and Fibrosis Response in an In Vitro Model of Tendon Cell Inflammation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) emerged as a promising therapy for tendon pathologies.

The development of photopolymerizable hydrogels has allowed for significant advances in cartilage repair procedures. Such three-dimensional (3D) networks of polymers that carry large amounts of water can be created to resemble the physical characteristics of the articular cartilage and be delivered into ill-defined cartilage defects as a liquid solution prior to polymerization in vivo for perfect fit with the surrounding native tissue. These hydrogels offer an adapted environment to encapsulate and propagate regenerative cells in 3D cultures for cartilage repair. Among them, mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes may represent the most adapted sources for implantation. They also represent platforms to deliver therapeutic, biologically active factors that promote 3D cell differentiation and maintenance for in vivo repair.

In the case of interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibition using its receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), like chondrocytes, synoviocytes also express IL-1 receptors that influence intra-articular IL-1 signaling and IL-1Ra efficacy. The short residence time of IL-1Ra after intra-articular injection requires the application of frequent dosing, which is clinically impractical and comes with increased risk of infection; these limitations motivate the development of effective drug delivery strategies that can maintain sustained intra-articular IL-1Ra concentrations with only a single injection. The goals of this study were to assess how the presence of synovium in IL-1-challenged cartilage-synovium co-culture impacts the time-dependent biological response of single and sustained doses of IL-1Ra, and to understand the mechanisms underlying any co-culture effects.
METHODS: Bovine cartilage explants with or without synovium were treated with IL-1α followed by single or multiple doses of IL-1Ra. Effects of IL-1Ra in rescuing IL-1α-induced catabolism in cartilage monoculture and cartilage-synovium co-culture were assessed by measuring loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and collagen using DMMB (dimethyl-methylene blue) and hydroxyproline assays, respectively, nitric oxide (NO) release using Griess assay, cell viability by fluorescence staining, metabolic activity using Alamar blue, and proteoglycan biosynthesis by radiolabel incorporation. Day 2 conditioned media from mono and co-cultures were analyzed by mass spectrometry and cytokine array to identify proteins unique to co-culture that contribute to biological crosstalk.
RESULTS: A single dose of IL-1Ra was ineffective, and a sustained dose was necessary to significantly suppress IL-1α-induced catabolism as observed by enhanced suppression of GAG and collagen loss, NO synthesis, rescue of chondrocyte metabolism, viability, and GAG biosynthesis rates. The synovium exhibited a protective role as the effects of single-dose IL-1Ra were significantly enhanced in cartilage-synovium co-culture and were accompanied by release of anti-catabolic factors IL-4, carbonic anhydrase-3, and matrilin-3. A total of 26 unique proteins were identified in conditioned media from co-cultures, while expression levels of many additional proteins important to cartilage homeostasis were altered in co-culture compared to monocultures; principal component analysis revealed distinct clustering between co-culture and cartilage and synovium monocultures, thereby confirming significant crosstalk.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-1Ra suppresses cytokine-induced catabolism in cartilage more effectively in the presence of synovium, which was associated with endogenous production of anti-catabolic factors. Biological crosstalk between cartilage and synovium is significant; thus, their co-cultures should better model the intra-articular actions of potential OA therapeutics. Additionally, chondroprotective effects of IL-1Ra require sustained drug levels, underscoring the need for developing drug delivery strategies to enhance its joint residence time following a single intra-articular injection.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Shikhar Mehta, Sumayyah Akhtar, Ryan M Porter, Patrik Önnerfjord, Ambika G Bajpayee<br><b>Journal:</b> Arthritis Res.

KS1 is characterized by intellectual disability, postnatal growth retardation, and distinct craniofacial dysmorphisms. A mouse model (Kmt2d+/βGeo) exhibits features of the human disorder and has provided insight into other phenotypes; however, the mechanistic basis of skeletal abnormalities and growth retardation remains elusive. Using high-resolution micro-CT, we show that Kmt2d+/βGeo mice have shortened long bones and ventral bowing of skulls. In vivo expansion of growth plates within skulls and long bones suggests disrupted endochondral ossification as a common disease mechanism. Stable chondrocyte cell lines harboring inactivating mutations in Kmt2d exhibit precocious differentiation, further supporting this mechanism. A known inducer of chondrogenesis, SOX9, and its targets show markedly increased expression in Kmt2d-/- chondrocytes. By transcriptome profiling, we identify Shox2 as a putative KMT2D target. We propose that decreased KMT2D-mediated H3K4me3 at Shox2 releases Sox9 inhibition and thereby leads to enhanced chondrogenesis, providing a potentially novel and plausible explanation for precocious chondrocyte differentiation.

Mechanisms for pathological vascular remodeling after hemophilic joint bleeding are unknown. In hemophilia, activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is impaired, which contributes to joint bleeding and may also underlie the aberrant vascular remodeling. Here, hemophilia A (factor VIII-deficient; FVIII-deficient) mice or TAFI-deficient mice with transient (antibody-induced) hemophilia A were used to determine the role of FVIII and TAFI in vascular remodeling after joint bleeding. Excessive vascular remodeling and vessel enlargement persisted in FVIII-deficient and TAFI-deficient mice, but not in transient hemophilia WT mice, after similar joint bleeding. TAFI-overexpression in FVIII-deficient mice prevented abnormal vessel enlargement and vascular leakage. Age-related vascular changes were observed with FVIII or TAFI deficiency and correlated positively with bleeding severity after injury, supporting increased vascularity as a major contributor to joint bleeding. Antibody-mediated inhibition of uPA also prevented abnormal vascular remodeling, suggesting that TAFI's protective effects include inhibition of uPA-mediated plasminogen activation. In conclusion, the functional TAFI deficiency in hemophilia drives maladaptive vascular remodeling in the joints after bleeding.

However, a protective effect of catalpol on uterine inflammation has not been reported. In this study, to investigate the protective mechanism of catalpol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs) and mouse endometritis, in vitro and in vivo inflammation models were established. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and its downstream inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot (WB), and immunofluorescence techniques. The results from ELISA and qRT-PCR showed that catalpol dose-dependently reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, and chemokines such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) and CXCL5, both in bEECs and in uterine tissue. From the experimental results of WB, qRT-PCR, and immunoﬂuorescence, the expression of TLR4 and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 were markedly inhibited by catalpol compared with the LPS group. The inflammatory damage to the mouse uterus caused by LPS was greatly reduced and was accompanied by a decline in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The results of this study suggest that catalpol can exert an anti-inflammatory impact on LPS-induced bEECs and mouse endometritis by inhibiting inflammation and activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Hua Zhang, Zhi-Min Wu, Ya-Ping Yang, Aftab Shaukat, Jing Yang, Ying-Fang Guo, Tao Zhang, Xin-Ying Zhu, Jin-Xia Qiu, Gan-Zhen Deng, Dong-Mei Shi<br><b>Journal:</b> J Zhejiang Univ Sci B<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1862-1783<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489801">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Aging Triggers H3K27 Trimethylation Hoarding in the Chromatin of <br><b>Abstract:</b> Aging associates with progressive loss of skeletal muscle function, sometimes leading to sarcopenia, a process characterized by impaired mobility and weakening of muscle strength.

It almost exclusively affects women, leading to considerable disability, daily functioning impairment, and psychosocial distress. Literature shows both scarce and conflicting data regarding its prevalence. Lipedema has been considered a rare entity by several authors, though it may be a far more frequent condition than thought. Despite the clinical impact on women's health, lipedema is in fact mostly unknown, underdiagnosed, and too often misdiagnosed with other similarly presenting diseases. Polygenic susceptibility combined with hormonal, microvascular, and lymphatic disorders may be partly responsible for its development. Furthermore, consistent information on lipedema pathophysiology is still lacking, and an etiological treatment is not yet available. Weight loss measures exhibit minimal effect on the abnormal body fat distribution, resulting in eating disorders, increased obesity risk, depression, and other psychological complaints. Surgical techniques, such as liposuction and excisional lipectomy, represent therapeutic options in selected cases. This review aims to outline current evidence regarding lipedema epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management. Increased awareness and a better understanding of its clinical presentation and pathophysiology are warranted to enable clinicians to diagnose and treat affected patients at an earlier stage.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Buso, Michele Depairon, Didier Tomson, Wassim Raffoul, Roberto Vettor, Lucia Mazzolai<br><b>Journal:</b> Obesity (Silver Spring)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1930-739X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544340">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Meta-analysis of FOXP3 gene rs3761548 and rs2232365 polymorphism and multiple sclerosis susceptibility.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), and is associated with genetic factors. FOXP3 gene polymorphism has been reported as the risk factor for MS, however, previous studies have showed conflicting results. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between FOXP3 gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to MS.
METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, library of Cochrane, and Web of Science were used to search the eligible articles from January 1980 up to October 2018. The odds ratio (ORs) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the strength of association. Allele model, homozygote model, heterozygote model, dominant model, and recessive model were used to evaluate the association between FOXP3 gene polymorphism and MS.
RESULTS: A total of 5 studies contained 1276 MS patients and 1447 controls (for rs3761548) and 600 MS patients and 640 controls (for rs2232365) were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The association showed significant differences in allele and dominant model for rs3761548 polymorphism. In addition, a clear tendency to significance was detected in homozygote and recessive model for rs3761548 (P = .052). Subgroup analysis indicated a significant risk of MS in all genotype models but heterozygotes in Asians.
CONCLUSION: FOXP3 gene polymorphism rs3761548 was associated with a higher MS risk, especially in Asians. This conclusion needs to be validated in more large samples and multiracial studies.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as regulators in gene expression networks, and participate in various biological processes. Recent studies have identified functional lncRNAs involved in skeletal muscle development and disease. These lncRNAs regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of myoblasts through multiple mechanisms, such as chromatin modification, transcription regulation, and microRNA sponge activity. In this review, we presented the latest advances regarding the functions and regulatory activities of lncRNAs involved in muscle development, muscle disease, and meat production.

So far, current treatments are limited to symptom relief, and no valid OA disease-modifying drugs are available. Additionally, OA relative joint is challenging for drug delivery, since the drugs experience rapid clearance in joint, showing a poor bioavailability. Existing therapeutic drugs, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids, are not conducive for long-term use due to adverse effects. Though supplementations, including chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine, have shown beneficial effects on joint tissues in OA, their therapeutic use is still debatable. New emerging agents, like Kartogenin (KGN) and Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra), without a proper formulation, still will not work. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a suitable and efficient drug delivery system for OA therapy.
