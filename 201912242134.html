Regenerative medicine relies mainly on the therapeutic potential of stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their immunosuppressive properties and tissue repair abilities, seem to be an ideal tool for cell-based therapies. Taking into account all available sources of MSCs, perinatal tissues become an attractive source of allogeneic MSCs. The allogeneic MSCs provide "off-the-shelf" cellular therapy, however, their allogenicity may be viewed as a limitation for their use. Moreover, some evidence suggests that MSCs are not as immune-privileged as it was previously reported. Therefore, understanding their interactions with the recipient's immune system is crucial for their successful clinical application. In this review, we discuss both autologous and allogeneic application of MSCs, focusing on current approaches to allogeneic MSCs therapies, with a particular interest in the role of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and HLA-matching in allogeneic MSCs transplantation. Importantly, the evidence from the currently completed and ongoing clinical trials demonstrates that allogeneic MSCs transplantation is safe and seems to cause no major side-effects to the patient. These findings strongly support the case for MSCs efficacy in treatment of a variety of diseases and their use as an "off-the-shelf" medical product.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766164">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 88â€‰247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, including patients, their families and friends.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562236">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Regenerative therapies in young hearts with structural or congenital heart disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Pediatric heart failure (HF) is rare. The prognosis is generally poor. HF is most frequently related to cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease (CHD). Associated phenotypes are HF with preserved (HFpEF) or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); both in children with biventricular or univentricular circulation. Cardiac growth, differentiation, proliferation and consecutively regenerative and repair mechanisms are inversely related to the patient's age; edaphic and circulating cardiac progenitor cells as well; in sum, there are enormous endogenous potentials repairing a diseased heart in particular in young children. Efforts supporting pediatric cardiac regeneration are clearly justified; cell-based therapies have been addressed in small series of children with end-stage HF of either the left or right ventricle, more recently in randomized clinical trials. Different cell populations like autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells, progenitor cells or cardiac derived cells have been injected into coronaries or directly into the myocardium. Beneficial at least transient improvement of cardiac function was observed in patients with dilative cardiomyopathy and CHD, mainly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Cellular repopulation and possibly more crucial, paracrine effects contributed in slowing down progression of pediatric end-stage HF. Our review summarizes the current knowledge in different scenarios of HF by cell-based cardiac therapies in critically ill children. Based on the actual clinical experience future work to distinguish responders from non-responders among other refinements will lead to individualized precision treatment of HF in children, what means a lot to a child on a long list waiting for heart transplantation (HTX).<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161081">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Role of the Stem Cells Therapy in the Peripheral Artery Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Vascular complications of diabetes mellitus are an important issue for all clinicians involved in the management of this complex pathology. Although many therapeutic advances have been reached, peripheral arterial disease is still an unsolved problem that each year compromises the quality of life and life span of affected patients. Oftentimes, patients, after ineffective attempts of revascularization, undergo greater amputations. At the moment, there is no effective and definitive treatment available. In this scenario, the therapeutic use of stem cells could be an interesting option. The aim of the present review is to gather all the best available evidence in this regard and to define a new role of the stem cells therapy in this field, from biomarker to possible therapeutic target.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067647">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><body><html>
