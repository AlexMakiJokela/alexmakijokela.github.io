Methods and Results: We measured fractional flow reserve (FFR), index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), and coronary flow reserve (CFR) before and after stenting in 42 consecutive subjects with stable coronary artery undergoing PCI with stent in the LAD. Patients that had very long stent length (38-78 mm) had lower FFR before stenting than patients that had long (23-37 mm) and moderate (12-22 mm) stent length (0.59 (±0.16), 0.70 (±0.12), and 0.75 (±0.07); 
Conclusions: Changes in IMR during PCI in the LAD in stable CAD seem to be related to total length of stents implanted, possibly influencing post-PCI FFR.

The systematic characterization of circulating proteins across different stages of HF may provide pathophysiological insights and identify therapeutic targets. Here we report application of aptamer-based proteomics to identify proteins associated with prospective HF incidence in a population-based cohort, implicating modulation of immunological, complement, coagulation, natriuretic and matrix remodeling pathways up to two decades prior to overt disease onset. We observe further divergence of these proteins from the general population in advanced HF, and regression after heart transplantation. By leveraging coronary sinus samples and transcriptomic tools, we describe likely cardiac and specific cellular origins for several of the proteins, including Nt-proBNP, thrombospondin-2, interleukin-18 receptor, gelsolin, and activated C5. Our findings provide a broad perspective on both cardiac and systemic factors associated with HF development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862877">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dystrophin and calcium current are decreased in cardiomyocytes expressing Cre enzyme driven by αMHC but not TNT promoter.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The Cre/lox system is a potent technology to control gene expression in mouse tissues.

Previous studies have revealed the important function of the β3 adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) in cardiovascular diseases, and the potential beneficial effects of numerous β3-AR agonists on pulmonary vasodilation. Conversely, a number of studies have proposed that the antagonism of β3-AR may prevent heart failure. The present study aimed to investigate the functional involvement of β3-AR and the effects of the β3-AR antagonist, SR59230A, in PAH and subsequent heart failure.

Exosomes were uncovered to mediate intercellular communication after MI. This study aims to explore the effect and mechanism of lncRNA KLF3-AS1 in exosomes secreted by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes and MI.
METHODS: Exosomes from hMSCs were isolated and identified. Exosomes from hMSCs with transfection of KLF3-AS1 for overexpression were injected into MI rat model or incubated with hypoxia cardiomyocytes. Effect of KLF3-AS1 on MI area, cell viability, apoptosis, and pyroptosis was determined. The relationship among miR-138-5p, KLF3-AS1, and Sirt1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Normal cardiomyocytes were transfected with miR-138-5p inhibitor or sh-Sirt1 to clarify whether alteration of miR-138-5p or sh-Sirt1 can regulate the effect of KLF3-AS1 on cardiomyocytes.
RESULTS: Exosomes from hMSCs were successfully extracted. Transfection of KLF3-AS1 exosome in rats and incubation with KLF3-AS1 exosome in hypoxia cardiomyocytes both verified that overexpression of KLF3-AS1 in exosomes leads to reduced MI area, decreased cell apoptosis and pyroptosis, and attenuated MI progression. KLF3-AS1 can sponge miR-138-5p to regulate Sirt1 expression. miR-138-5p inhibitor transfection and KLF3-AS1 exosome incubation contribute to attenuated pyroptosis and MI both in vivo and in vitro, while transfection of sh-Sirt1 could reverse the protective effect of exosomal KLF3-AS1 on hypoxia cardiomyocytes.
CONCLUSION: LncRNA KLF3-AS1 in exosomes secreted from hMSCs by acting as a ceRNA to sponge miR-138-5p can regulate Sirt1 so as to inhibit cell pyroptosis and attenuate MI progression.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31847890">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Case reports of a c.475G>T, p.E159* lamin A/C mutation with a family history of conduction disorder, dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Patients with some mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene are characterized by the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), conduction abnormalities, ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Various clinical features have been observed among patients who have the same LMNA mutation. Here, we show a family with cardiac laminopathy with a c.475G > T, p.E159* LMNA mutation, and a family history of conduction disorder, DCM, VT, and SCD.
CASE PRESENTATION: A proband (female) with atrial fibrillation and bradycardia was implanted with a pacemaker in her fifties. Twenty years later, she experienced a loss of consciousness due to polymorphic VT. She had a serious family history; her mother and elder sister died suddenly in their fifties and sixties, respectively, and her nephew and son were diagnosed as having DCM. Genetic screening of the proband, her son, and nephew identified a nonsense mutation (c.475G > T, p.E159*) in the LMNA gene. Although the proband's left ventricular ejection fraction remained relatively preserved, her son and nephew's left ventricular ejection fraction were reduced, resulting in cardiac resynchronization therapy by implantation of a defibrillator.
CONCLUSIONS: In this family with cardiac laminopathy with a c.475G > T, p.E159* LMNA mutation, DCM, SCD, and malignant VT occurred. Clinical manifestation of various atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction occurred in an age-dependent manner in all family members who had the nonsense mutation. It appears highly likely that the E159* LMNA mutation is related to various cardiac problems in the family of the current report.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31847799">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Evolving Role of Brentuximab Vedotin in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The arrival of the CD30 directed antibody-drug conjugate, brentuximab vedotin (BV), has altered the approach to patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Exosomes carry several signaling biomolecules, including miRNA, proteins, enzymes, cell surface receptors, growth factors, cytokines and lipids that can modulate target cell biology and function. Due to these capabilities, exosomes have emerged as novel intercellular signaling mediators in both homeostasis and pathophysiological conditions. Recent studies document that exosomes (both circulating or released from heart tissue) have been actively involved in cardiac remodeling in response to stressors. Also, exosomes released from progenitor/stem cells have protective effects in heart diseases and shown to have regenerative potential in the heart. In this review we discuss- the critical role played by circulating exosomes released from various tissues and from cells within the heart in cardiac health; the gap in knowledge that needs to be addressed to promote future research; and exploitation of recent advances in exosome engineering to develop novel therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31850349">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Editorial: Cardioimmunology: Inflammation and Immunity in Cardiovascular Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31850376">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Cardiotoxicity: Current Understanding on Its Mechanism, Diagnosis and Management.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, programmed cell death-1, and PD-ligand 1 have revolutionized cancer treatment, achieving unprecedented efficacy in multiple malignancies. ICIs are increasingly being used in early cancer settings and in combination with various other types of therapies, including targeted therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, despite the excellent therapeutic effect of ICIs, these medications typically result in a broad spectrum of toxicity reactions, termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Of all irAEs, cardiotoxicity, uncommon but with high mortality, has not been well recognized. Herein, based on previous published reports and current evidence, we summarize the incidence, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, underlying mechanisms, treatments, and outcomes of ICI-associated cardiotoxicity and discuss possible management strategies. A better understanding of these characteristics is critical to managing patients with ICI-associated cardiotoxicity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849640">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Getting to the Heart of the Matter: The Role of Regulatory T-Cells (Tregs) in Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Atherosclerosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Atherosclerosis is directly associated with CVD and is characterized by slow progressing inflammation which results in the deposition and accumulation of lipids beneath the endothelial layer in conductance and resistance arteries. Both chronic inflammation and disease progression have been associated with several risk factors, including but not limited to smoking, obesity, diabetes, genetic predisposition, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Currently, despite increasing incidence and significant expense on the healthcare system in both western and developing countries, there is no curative therapy for atherosclerosis. Instead patients rely on surgical intervention to avoid or revert vessel occlusion, and pharmacological management of the aforementioned risk factors. However, neither of these approaches completely resolve the underlying inflammatory environment which perpetuates the disease, nor do they result in plaque regression. As such, immunomodulation could provide a novel therapeutic option for atherosclerosis; shifting the balance from proatherogenic to athero-protective.

Here, we conducted a preclinical systematic review of 15 studies including 577 animals to establish the efficacy and potential mechanisms of AS-IV for animal models of viral myocarditis (VM). Six databases were searched from inception to October 2018. Application of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool 10-item checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software to analyze risk of bias of studies and data on outcome measures revealed study quality scores ranging from 2 to 5. Compared with the control group, AS-IV induced a marked decrease in mortality (P < 0.05), inflammation of myocardium and pathological score (P< 0.05) and cardiac enzymes expression (P< 0.05), and improved the function of the heart (P< 0.05). The potential mechanisms of AS-IV action were determined as anti-remodeling of myocardium (n = 1), anti-virus (n = 2), antioxidant (n = 2), anti-inflammatory (n = 6), anti-apoptosis (n = 1) and alleviation of myocardial fibrosis (n = 2).

HIGHLIGHTS: - Titin (TTN) truncation variants are the most frequent cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, one of the main causes of heart failure and heart transplant. Titin is a giant protein, and the mechanisms causing the disease are both complex and still incompletely understood.- This review discusses the role of titin in myocardial function and in disease. In particular, we discuss TTN gene structure, the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlation in human disease, the physiology of TTN and the role of post-translation modification.- Additional studies will be required to clarify whether missense variants are associated with cardiac disease. While initial studies suggested a role of non-synonymous variants in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, confirmatory investigations have been hampered by the complexity of the protein structure and function.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849696">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Live Intravital Imaging of Cellular Trafficking in the Cardiac Microvasculature-Beating the Odds.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Although mortality rates from cardiovascular disease in the developed world are falling, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not. Each year, the number of people either being diagnosed as suffering with CVD or undergoing a surgical procedure related to it, such as percutaneous coronary intervention, continues to increase. In order to ensure that we can effectively manage these diseases in the future, it is critical that we fully understand their basic physiology and their underlying causative factors. Over recent years, the important role of the cardiac microcirculation in both acute and chronic disorders of the heart has become clear. The recruitment of inflammatory cells into the cardiac microcirculation and their subsequent activation may contribute significantly to tissue damage, adverse remodeling, and poor outcomes during recovery. However, our basic understanding of the cardiac microcirculation is hampered by an historic inability to image the microvessels of the beating heart-something we have been able to achieve in other organs for over 100 years. This stems from a couple of clear and obvious difficulties related to imaging the heart-firstly, it has significant inherent contractile motion and is affected considerably by the movement of lungs. Secondly, it is located in an anatomically challenging position for microscopy. However, recent microscopic and technological developments have allowed us to overcome some of these challenges and to begin to answer some of the basic outstanding questions in cardiac microvascular physiology, particularly in relation to inflammatory cell recruitment. In this review, we will discuss some of the historic work that took place in the latter part of last century toward cardiac intravital, before moving onto the advanced work that has been performed since. This work, which has utilized technology such as spinning-disk confocal and multiphoton microscopy, has-along with some significant advancements in algorithms and software-unlocked our ability to image the "business end" of the cardiac vascular tree. This review will provide an overview of these techniques, as well as some practical pointers toward software and other tools that may be useful for other researchers who are considering utilizing this technique themselves.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849965">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis Identifies Critical Genes in the Development of Heart Failure After Acute Myocardial Infarction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31850068">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of Shenfu Injection in Rats With Ischemic Heart Failure and Its Effect on Small Molecules Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Mass Spectrometry Imaging.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849672">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Visualizing Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate in Cardiac Microdomains Involved in Ion Homeostasis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> 3',5'-Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a key second messenger that regulates function of proteins involved in ion homeostasis and cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.

In this mini review, we describe how such localized signals can be visualized in living cardiomyocytes to better understand cardiac physiology and disease.

Here, we derived dietary patterns by principal component analysis (PCA) and evaluated their association with LV structure, function, and remodelling. Our cross-sectional study included 438 members (aged 25-65 years; 59.1% women) of the Kardiovize Brno 2030 with no history of cardiovascular disease. Two dietary patterns were derived using PCA, namely prudent and western. Primary outcomes were echocardiographic parameters and LV geometric patterns, such as concentric LV remodelling (cLVR), concentric LVH (cLVH), and eccentric LVH (eLVH). Interestingly, participants with high adherence to the prudent dietary pattern had decreased odds of cLVH after adjustment for socio-demographic, clinical and behavioral covariates (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.08-0.88; p = 0.031). By contrast, several echocardiographic parameters increased with increasing adherence to the western dietary pattern, which resulted in higher odds of cLVH among participants with high adherence (OR = 5.38, 95% CI = 1.17-23.58; p = 0.035). Although our findings may have an immediate relevance for public-health strategies, further large-size prospective studies should be encouraged to better understand the observed association and their causality.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-17<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31844105">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Circulating proteomic signature of early death in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Heart failure (HF) remains a main cause of mortality worldwide. Risk stratification of patients with systolic chronic HF is critical to identify those who may benefit from advanced HF therapies. The aim of this study is to identify plasmatic proteins that could predict the early death (within 3 years) of HF patients with reduced ejection fraction hospitalized in CHRU de Lille. The subproteome targeted by an aptamer-based technology, the Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA) scan assay of 1310 proteins, was profiled in blood samples from 168 HF patients, and 203 proteins were significantly modulated between patients who died of cardiovascular death and patients who were alive after 3 years of HF evaluation (Wilcoxon test, FDR 5%). A molecular network was built using these 203 proteins, and the resulting network contained 2281 molecules assigned to 34 clusters annotated to biological pathways by Gene Ontology. This network model highlighted extracellular matrix organization as the main mechanism involved in early death in HF patients. In parallel, an adaptive Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was performed on these 203 proteins, and six proteins were selected as candidates to predict early death in HF patients: complement C3, cathepsin S and F107B were decreased and MAPK5, MMP1 and MMP7 increased in patients who died of cardiovascular causes compared with patients living 3 years after HF evaluation. This proteomic signature of 6 circulating plasma proteins allows the identification of systolic HF patients with a risk of early death.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-17<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31844116">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Value of exercise stress electrocardiography for stratification of exercise capacity and left ventricular systolic and diastolic function on coronary slow flow: case-control study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Coronary slow flow phenomenon (CSFP) is an angiographic entity characterized by delayed coronary opacification in absence of evident obstructive lesion in the epicardial coronary artery. However, whether patients with CSFP exhibit differing responses to exercise is still not known. This study aimed to evaluate results of exercise stress electrocardiography (ExECG) and left ventricular (LV) function during exercise, and study the value of ExECG for stratification of exercise capacity and LV function in patients with CSFP.
METHODS: Thirty patients with CSFP and 24 controls were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of CSFP was made by Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction frame count. ExECG and LV function measured by echocardiography at rest, during exercise and recovery phase were evaluated.
RESULTS: Negative ExECG was found in 24 (80%) patients with CSFP. At rest, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) decreased and mitral average E/e' increased in patients with CSFP compared with controls; however, there were no differences in these parameters between CSFP patients with negative ExECG and patients with positive ExECG. During exercise, CSFP patients with negative ExECG and controls had significantly increased LV GLS and decreased mitral average E/e', but CSFP patients with positive ExECG had significantly decreased LV GLS and increased mitral average E/e'.
CONCLUSIONS: About 80% patients with CSFP exhibited negative ExECG. CSFP patients with negative ExECG exhibited improved LV function but CSFP patients with positive ExECG exhibited impaired LV function during exercise. ExECG may aid in the stratification of exercise capacity and LV function in patients with CSFP.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830922">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Long term CMR follow up of patients with right ventricular abnormality and clinically suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The Task Force Criteria (TFC) for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) was updated in 2010 to improve specificity. There was concern however that the revised cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) criteria was too restrictive and not sensitive enough to detect early forms of the condition. We previously described patients with clinically suspected ARVC who satisfied criteria from non-imaging TFC categories and fulfilled parameters from the original but not the revised CMR criteria; as a result, these patients were not confirmed as definite ARVC but may represent an early phenotype.
METHODS: Patients scanned between 2008 and 2015 who had either right ventricular (RV) dilatation or regional dyskinesia satisfying at least minor imaging parameters from the original criteria and without contra-indication underwent serial CMR scanning using a 1.5 T scanner. The aims were to assess the risk of progressive RV abnormalities, evaluate the accuracy of the revised CMR criteria and the need for guideline directed CMR surveillance in at-risk individuals.
RESULTS: Overall, 48 patients were re-scanned; 24 had a first-degree relative diagnosed with ARVC using the revised TFC or a first-degree relative with premature sudden death from suspected ARVC and 24 patients had either left bundle branch morphology ventricular tachycardia or > 500 ventricular extra-systoles in 24-h. Mean follow up was 69+/- 25 months. The indexed RV end-diastolic, end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction were calculated for both scans. There was significant reduction in RV volumes and improvement in RV ejection fraction (EF) irrespective of changes to body surface area; - 11.7+/- 15.2 mls/m
CONCLUSION: The revised CMR criteria represents a robust tool in the evaluation of patients with clinical suspicion of ARVC, especially for those with ventricular arrhythmias without a family history for ARVC. For patients with RV abnormalities that do not fulfill the revised criteria but have a family history of ARVC or an ARVC associated gene mutation, a surveillance CMR scan should be considered as part of the clinical follow up protocol.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831077">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Aortic elasticity after aortic coarctation relief: comparison of surgical and interventional therapy by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Patients after aortic coarctation (CoA) repair show impaired aortic bioelasticity and altered left ventricular (LV) mechanics, predisposing diastolic dysfunction. Our purpose was to assess aortic bioelasticity and LV properties in CoA patients who underwent endovascular stenting or surgery using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.
METHODS: Fifty CoA patients (20.5 ± 9.5 years) were examined by 3-Tesla CMR. Eighteen patients had previous stent implantation and 32 had surgical repair. We performed volumetric analysis of both ventricles (LV, RV) and left atrium (LA) to measure biventricular volumes, ejection fractions, left atrial (LA) volumes, and functional parameters (LAEF
RESULTS: LV, RV and LA parameters did not differ between the surgical and stent group. There was also no significant difference for aortic distensibility, PWV and T1 relaxation times. Aortic root distensibility correlated negatively with age, BMI, BSA and weight (p < 0.001). Native T1 values correlated negatively with age, weight, BSA and BMI (p < 0.001). Lower post-contrast T1 values were associated with lower aortic arch distensibility and higher aortic arch PWV (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: CoA patients after surgery or stent implantation did not show significant difference of aortic elasticity. Thus, presumably other factors like intrinsic aortic abnormalities might have a greater impact on aortic elasticity than the approach of repair.

Skeletal muscle weakness progressively develops in DMD patients and usually leads to respiratory failure in the early adolescent years. Cardiac muscle is frequently affected in DMD patients, which leads to a high burden of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In the era of improved respiratory care, cardiac deaths are becoming the major cause of mortality in DMD patients.
CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented to the hospital due to recurrent orthopnea for 6 mo and palpitations for 4 mo. He was diagnosed with progressive muscular dystrophy at the age of 3 years and was confined to a wheelchair at 12 years. He was prescribed diuretics and digoxin at the outpatient clinic; however, his symptoms did not resolve. Sacubitril/valsartan was added 1 mo prior to presentation, but he experienced recurrent episodes of palpitations. The electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 201 bpm, and he was then hospitalized. Hypotension was found following the administration of sacubitril/valsartan tablets; he could not tolerate even a small dose, always developing tachyarrhythmia. His symptoms were relieved after discontinuing sacubitril/valsartan, and his heart rate was controlled by a small dose of metoprolol tartrate and digoxin. Atrial tachycardia spontaneously converted in this patient, and his symptoms attenuated in the following 6 mo, without palpitation episodes.
CONCLUSION: Blood pressure should be closely monitored in DMD patients with advanced heart failure when taking sacubitril/valsartan.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31832414">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nicorandil: A drug with ongoing benefits and different mechanisms in various diseased conditions.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Nicorandil is a well-known antianginal agent, which has been recommended as one of the second-line treatments for chronic stable angina as justified by the European guidelines. It shows an efficacy equivalent to that of classic antianginal agents. Nicorandil has also been applied clinically in various cardiovascular diseases such as variant or unstable angina and reperfusion-induced damage following coronary angioplasty or thrombolysis. Different mechanisms have been involved in the protective effects of nicorandil in various diseases through either opening of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel or donation of nitric oxide (NO). The predominance or participation of any of these proposed mechanisms depends on the dose of nicorandil used, the location of diseased conditions, and if this mechanism is still functioning or not. The protection afforded by nicorandil has been shown to be mainly attributed to KATP channel opening in experimental models of myocardial and pulmonary fibrosis as well as renal injury or glomerulonephritis, whereas NO donation predominates as a mechanism of protection in hepatic fibrosis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Therefore, in different diseased conditions, it is important to know which mechanism plays the major role in nicorandil-induced curative or protective effects. This can bring new insights into the proper use of selected medication and its recommended dose for targeting certain disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831918">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Lingguizhugan decoction attenuates doxorubicin-induced heart failure in rats by improving TT-SR microstructural remodeling.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Lingguizhugan decoction (LGZG), an ancient Chinese herbal formula, has been used to treat cardiovascular diseases in eastern Asia. We investigated whether LGZG has protective activity and the mechanism underlying its effect in an animal model of heart failure (HF).
METHODS: A rat model of HF was established by administering eight intraperitoneal injections of doxorubicin (DOX) (cumulative dose of 16 mg/kg) over a 4-week period. Subsequently, LGZG at 5, 10, and 15 mL/kg/d was administered to the rats intragastrically once daily for 4 weeks. The body weight, heart weight index (HWI), heart weight/tibia length ratio (HW/TL), and serum BNP level were investigated to assess the effect of LGZG on HF. Echocardiography was performed to investigate cardiac function, and H&E staining to visualize myocardial morphology. Myocardial ultrastructure and T-tubule-sarcoplasmic reticulum (TT-SR) junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The JP-2 protein level was determined by Western blotting. The mRNA level of CACNA1S and RyR2 and the microRNA-24 (miR-24) level were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Four weeks after DOX treatment, rats developed cardiac damage and exhibited a significantly increased BNP level compared with the control rats (169.6 ± 29.6 pg/mL versus 80.1 ± 9.8 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Conversely, LGZG, especially at the highest dose, markedly reduced the BNP level (93.8 ± 17.9 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Rats treated with DOX developed cardiac dysfunction, characterized by a strong decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction compared with the control (58.5 ± 8.7% versus 88.7 ± 4.0%; P < 0.001). Digoxin and LGZG improved cardiac dysfunction (79.6 ± 6.1%, 69.2 ± 2.5%, respectively) and preserved the left ventricular ejection fraction (77.9 ± 5.1, and 80.5 ± 4.9, respectively, P < 0.01). LGZG also improved the LVEDD, LVESD, and FS and eliminated ventricular hypertrophy, as indicated by decreased HWI and HW/TL ratio. LGZG attenuated morphological abnormalities and mitochondrial damage in the myocardium. In addition, a high dose of LGZG significantly downregulated the expression of miR-24 compared with that in DOX-treated rats (fold change 1.4 versus 3.4, P < 0.001), but upregulated the expression of JP-2 and antagonized DOX-induced T-tubule TT-SR microstructural remodeling. These activities improved periodic Ca
CONCLUSIONS: LGZG exerted beneficial effects on DOX-induced HF in rats, which were mediated in part by improved TT-SR microstructural remodeling.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829159">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficacy and safety of oral Guanxinshutong capsules in patients with stable angina pectoris in China: a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral Guanxinshutong (GXST) capsules in Chinese patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) in a prospective, multicenter, double-Blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02280850).
METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to the GXST or placebo group. Current standard antianginal treatment except for nitrate drugs was continued in both groups, who received an additional 4-week treatment of GXST capsule or placebo. Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in angina attack frequency after the 4-week treatment. Secondary endpoints included the reduction of nitroglycerin dose, score of Seatntle Agina Questionnaire, exercise tolerance test defined as time to onset of chest pain and ST-segment depression at least 1 mm greater than the resting one.
RESULTS: A total of 300 SAP patients from 12 centers in China were enrolled between January 2013 and October 2015, and they were randomly divided into the GXST group and the placebo group (150 patients in each group). Of whom, 287 patients completed the study (143 patients in the GXST group, 144 patients in the placebo group). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. After 4-week treatment with GXST capsules, the number of angina attacks and the consumption of short-acting nitrates were significantly reduced. In addition, the quality of life of patients were also substantially improved in the GXST group. No significant differences in the time of onset of angina and 1-mm ST segment depression were noted between the two groups. 7 patients (4.1%) in the GXST group and 3 patients (2.1%) in the placebo group reported at least one adverse event, respectively.

It is commonly present in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), irrespective of the level of blood pressure; recently, oxidative stress has been shown to be an important factor in its development. The question then arises: can this risk factor be modified by antioxidant treatment (e.g., with allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor)?
Methods: This is an observational study with a cross-sectional design which explored the association between long-term (>12 months) allopurinol therapy and LV mass index (LVMI) as well as geometry in patients generally receiving standard treatments for IHD. The primary endpoint was LVMI measurement (by 2D-echocardiography) and secondary endpoints included the association of allopurinol use with LV function (ejection fraction), blood pressure, glycemic control, and lipid profile.
Results: Ninety-six patients on standard anti-ischemic drug treatment (control group) and 96 patients who were additionally taking allopurinol (minimum dose 100 mg/day) were enrolled. Both groups were matched for age, sex, height, and co-morbidities, but poorer kidney function in the allopurinol group required further sub-group analysis based on renal function. Allopurinol treatment was associated with the lowest LVMI in the patients with normal serum creatinine (median LVMI; 70.5 g/m
Conclusion: In our population, treatment with allopurinol (presumably because of its anti-oxidant properties) has shown a tendency to be associated with smaller LVM in IHD patients with normal serum creatinine, along with better glycemic control.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31827327">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Educational Case: Dysproteinemic Nephropathies: Renal Amyloidosis as an Example.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828220">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Personalized Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine: Targeting the Extreme Stages of Life.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cardiovascular regenerative medicine is an exciting new approach that promises to change the current care of million people world-wide.

Increases in O-GlcNAcylation have shown beneficial cardiovascular effects in acute pathologies. We used two different rat models to evaluate the beneficial effects of O-GlcNAc stimulation at the early phase of septic shock. Rats received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce endotoxemic shock or saline (control) and fluid resuscitation (R) with or without O-GlcNAc stimulation (NButGT-10 mg/kg) 1 hour after shock induction. For the second model, rats received cecal ligature and puncture (CLP) surgery and fluid therapy with or without NButGT. Cardiovascular function was evaluated and heart and blood samples were collected and analysed. NButGT treatment efficiently increased total O-GlcNAc without modification of HBP enzyme expression.Treatment improved circulating parameters and cardiovascular function in both models, and restored SERCA2a expression levels.

A total of 381 participants (median age 57 years) of the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) FF4 cohort underwent CMR. The participants' smoking and sporting habits were measured by a questionnaire. Physical inactivity was associated with a reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF), stroke volume, early diastolic peak filling rate and peak ejection rate of the left ventricle as well as right ventricular stroke volume. LV-EF was reduced in subjects with almost no physical activity compared to subjects with regular physical activity (68.4%, 95%CI 66.8-70.1% vs. 70.8%, 95%CI 69.2-72.3%, p < 0,05).

We hypothesized that T3 treatment could prevent adverse post-infarction cardiomyocyte remodeling by maintaining transverse-tubule (TT) structures, thus improving calcium dynamics and contractility. METHODS: Myocardial infarction (MI) or sham surgeries were performed on female Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 12 wks), followed by treatment with T3 (5μg/kg/d) or vehicle in drinking water for 16 wks (n = 10-11/group). After in vivo echocardiographic and hemodynamic analyses, left ventricular myocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion and simultaneous calcium and contractile transients in single cardiomyocytes were recorded using IonOptix imaging. Live cardiomyocytes were stained with AlexaFluor-488 conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-488) or di-8-ANEPPS, and multiple z-stack images per cell were captured by confocal microscopy for analysis of TT organization. RTqPCR and immunoblot approaches determined expression of TT proteins. RESULTS: Echocardiography and in vivo hemodynamic measurements showed significant improvements in systolic and diastolic function in T3- vs vehicle-treated MI rats.

However, the molecular mechanism of sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction has not yet been thoroughly studied. Resveratrol has been an important research topic due its organ-protection function, but the specific mechanism is unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism of organ injury in sepsis and to investigate the molecular mechanism of resveratrol in myocardial protection in sepsis. MATERIAL AND METHODS A classical Sprague-Dawley rat model of sepsis peritonitis was constructed for further experiments. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and resveratrol were used to intervene in a rat model of cardiomyopathy. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Western blot analysis was used to detect the level of maker proteins. RESULTS The PI3K inhibitors could promote cardiac abnormalities and apoptosis, but resveratrol showed the opposite effect. The upregulation function of the PI3K inhibitor on the expression of NF-kappaB, IL-6, IL-1ß, and TLR4 in LPS rats was not obvious, but the expression of TNF-a in LPS+LY294002 rats was increased by 22.85% compared with that in LPS rats (P<0.05). Compared with the LPS group, the expression of NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1ß, and TLR4 in the LPS+resveratrol group was decreased. The expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR in LPS+LY294002 was reduced. The expression p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR in the myocardium of the LPS+resveratrol group was increased.

Thus, LV diastolic function should be considered a crucial marker of a preclinical form of DM-related cardiac dysfunction. However, the impact of glycemic variability (GV) on LV diastolic function in such patients remains unclear.
METHODS: We studied 100 asymptomatic T2DM patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF) without coronary artery disease (age: 60 ± 14 years, female: 45%). GV was evaluated as standard deviation of blood glucose level using continuous glucose monitoring system for at least 72 consecutive hours. LV diastolic function was defined as mitral inflow E and mitral e' annular velocities (E/e'), and > 14 was determined as abnormal.
RESULTS: E/e' in patients with high GV (≥ 35.9 mg/dL) was significantly higher than that in patients with low GV (11.3 ± 3.9 vs. 9.8 ± 2.8, p = 0.03) despite similar age, gender-distribution, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that GV ≥ 35.9 mg/dL (odds ratio: 3.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-13.22; p < 0.05) was an independently associated factor, as was age, of E/e' > 14. In sequential logistic models for the associations of LV diastolic dysfunction, one model based on clinical variables including age, gender and hypertension was not improved by addition of HbA1c (p = 0.67) but was improved by addition of high GV (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Since HFpEF is a syndrome caused by diverse agents, reducing GV may represent a potential new therapeutic strategy for the prevention of the development of HFpEF in T2DM patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31805945">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Risk Stratification for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Risk assessment models developed from administrative and clinical databases are used for clinical decision making.

Objective: To determine the association of β-blocker use with HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, overall and in strata of patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% or greater or less than 50%.
Design, Setting, and Participants: For 1761 participants from North and South America enrolled in the multicenter, double-blinded Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist randomized clinical trial of spironolactone for patients with HFpEF between August 10, 2006, and January 31, 2012, the association of baseline β-blocker use with HF hospitalization and CVD mortality was analyzed using unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, overall and in strata of patients with an EF of 50% or greater or less than 50%. Participants had symptomatic HF with a left ventricular EF of 45% or greater, with enrollment based on either hospitalization attributed to decompensated HF in the prior year or elevated natriuretic peptide levels. Statistical analysis was performed from January 31 to May 2, 2019.
Exposure: Use of β-blockers.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident HF hospitalization and CVD mortality.
Results: Among 1761 participants included in the analysis (879 women and 882 men; mean [SD] age, 71.5 [9.6] years), 1394 (79.2%) reported β-blocker use and 1567 (89.0%) had an EF of 50% or greater. Hospitalizations for HF occurred for 399 participants (22.7%), and CVD mortality occurred for 229 participants (13.0%). Use of β-blockers was associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization among patients with HFpEF with an EF of 50% or greater (hazard ratio, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.28-2.37]; P < .001) but not among patients with an EF between 45% and 49% (hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.28-1.63]; P = .39). There was a significant interaction between β-blocker use and EF threshold for incident HF hospitalizations (P = .03). Use of β-blockers was not associated with a change in CVD mortality.
Conclusions and Relevance: For patients with an EF of 50% or greater, β-blocker use was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalizations but not CVD mortality. For patients with an EF between 45% and 49%, there was no such association.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31800067">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Skeletal muscle alterations in tachycardia-induced heart failure are linked to deficient natriuretic peptide signalling and are attenuated by RAS-/NEP-inhibition.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Heart failure induced cachexia is highly prevalent. Insights into disease progression are lacking.
METHODS: Early state of left ventricular dysfunction (ELVD) and symptomatic systolic heart failure (HF) were both induced in rabbits by tachypacing. Tissue of limb muscle (LM) was subjected to histologic assessment. For unbiased characterisation of early and late myopathy, a proteomic approach followed by computational pathway-analyses was performed and combined with pathway-focused gene expression analyses. Specimen of thoracic diaphragm (TD) served as control for inactivity-induced skeletal muscle alterations. In a subsequent study, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-system and neprilysin (RAS-/NEP) was compared to placebo.
RESULTS: HF was accompanied by loss of protein content (8.7±0.4% vs. 7.0±0.5%, mean±SEM, control vs. HF, p<0.01) and a slow-to-fast fibre type switch, establishing hallmarks of cachexia. In ELVD, the enzymatic set-up of LM and TD shifted to a catabolic state. A disturbed malate-aspartate shuttle went well with increased enzymes of glycolysis, forming the enzymatic basis for enforced anoxic energy regeneration. The histological findings and the pathway analysis of metabolic results drew the picture of suppressed PGC-1α signalling, linked to the natriuretic peptide system. In HF, natriuretic peptide signalling was desensitised, as confirmed by an increase in the ratio of serum BNP to tissue cGMP (57.0±18.6pg/ml/nM/ml vs. 165.8±16.76pg/ml/nM/ml, p<0.05) and a reduced expression of natriuretic peptide receptor-A. In HF, combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition prevented from loss in protein content (8.7±0.3% vs. 6.0±0.6% vs. 8.3±0.9%, Baseline vs. HF-Placebo vs. HF-RAS/NEP, p<0.05 Baseline vs. HF-Placebo, p = 0.7 Baseline vs. HF-RAS/NEP).
CONCLUSIONS: Tachypacing-induced heart failure entails a generalised myopathy, preceding systolic dysfunction. The characterisation of "pre-cachectic" state and its progression is feasible. Early enzymatic alterations of LM depict a catabolic state, rendering LM prone to futile substrate metabolism. A combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition ameliorates cardiac-induced myopathy independent of systolic function, which could be linked to stabilised natriuretic peptide/cGMP/PGC-1α signalling.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31800630">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and echocardiographic exam: an useful interaction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is a functional assessment that helps to detect disorders affecting the system involved in oxygen transport and utilization through the analysis of the gas exchange during exercise.

Limited data exists about the indication and physiologic state of the patient at the time of intubation, the location in which it occurs, or patient outcomes afterward.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on all emergent airway management interventions performed outside of the operating room over a 6-month period. Documentation included intubation performance, and intubation related complications and mortality. Additional information including demographics, ASA-classification, comorbidities, hospital-stay, ICU-stay, and 30-day in-hospital mortality was obtained.
RESULTS: 336 intubations were performed in 275 patients during the six-month period. The majority of intubations (n = 196, 58%) occurred in an ICU setting, and the rest 140 (42%) occurred on a normal floor or in a remote location. The mean admission ASA status was 3.6 ± 0.5, age 60 ± 16 years, and BMI 30 ± 9 kg/m
CONCLUSION: Patients requiring emergent airway management are a high-risk patient population with multiple comorbidities and high ASA scores on admission.

This study investigated the role that endogenous microRNA-146a plays in myocardial ischaemia reperfusion and explored the possible target genes.
Methods: MIRI models were established in microRNA-146a deficient (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. MicroRNA-146a expression was evaluated in the myocardium of WT mice after reperfusion. The heart function, area of myocardium infarction and in situ apoptosis were compared between the KO and WT mice. Microarray was used to explore possible target genes of microRNA-146a, while qRT-PCR and dual luciferase reporter assays were used for verification. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression levels of the target gene and related signalling molecules. A rescue study was used for further testing.
Results: MicroRNA-146a was upregulated 1 h after reperfusion. MicroRNA-146a deficiency decreased heart function and increased myocardial infarction and apoptosis. Microarray detected 19 apoptosis genes upregulated in the KO mice compared with the WT mice. qRT-PCR and dual luciferase verified that Med1 was one target gene of microRNA-146a. TRAP220, encoded by Med1 in the KO mice, was upregulated, accompanied by an amplified ratio of Bax/Bcl2 and increased cleaved caspase-3. Inhibition of microRNA-146a in H9C2 cells caused increased TRAP220 expression and more apoptosis under the stimulus of hypoxia and re-oxygenation, while knockdown of the increased TRAP220 expression led to decreased cell apoptosis.
Conclusions: MicroRNA-146a exerts a protective effect against MIRI, which might be partially mediated by the target gene Med1 and related to the apoptosis signalling pathway.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798643">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Multi-modality imaging in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Transthyretin amyloid (TTR) cardiomyopathy is a disease of insidious onset, which is often accompanied by debilitating neurological and/or cardiac complications. The true prevalence is not fully known due to its elusive presentation, being often under-recognized and usually diagnosed only late in its natural history and in older patients. Because of this, effective treatment options are usually precluded by multiple comorbidities and frailty associated with such patients. Therefore, high clinical suspicion with earlier and better detection of this disease is needed. In this review, the novel applications of multimodality imaging in the diagnostic pathway of TTR cardiomyopathy are explored. These include the complimentary roles of transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, nuclear scintigraphy and positron emission tomography in quantifying cardiac dysfunction, diagnosis and risk stratification. Recent advances in novel therapeutic options for TTR have further enhanced the importance of a timely and accurate diagnosis of this disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798793">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cecal Volvulus in a child with congenital dilated cardiomyopathy: A case report.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Cecal volvulus is an extremely rare cause of intestinal obstruction in the pediatric age group and its incidence is unknown.

Successful public health interventions for type 2 diabetes mean that patients more frequently present with HF without a prior ischemic event, which is likely to change outcomes, but trends in cause-specific outcomes are unknown.
Objective: To investigate cause-specific outcomes and trends associated with type 2 diabetes among individuals with incident HF.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used UK primary care data, linked to hospital admissions and mortality, for 87 709 patients with incident HF from 1998 to 2017. Patients were 30 years or older and observed to death or July 31, 2017. Data analysis was conducted in March and April 2019.
Exposure: Preexisting type 2 diabetes at diagnosis of HF. Individuals with type 1 diabetes were excluded.
Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause, cardiovascular (CVD), and non-CVD unplanned hospitalizations and mortality rates.
Results: Of 87 709 patients with HF (43 173 [49.2%] women; 78 211 [89.2%] white), 20 858 (23.8%) had type 2 diabetes (median [interquartile range] age, 78.0 [70.0 to 84.0] years), and 66 851 (76.2%) had no diabetes (median [interquartile range] age, 80.0 [72.0 to 86.0] years). In patients with HF, type 2 diabetes was associated with an increase in the risk of unplanned hospital admission (adjusted incidence rate ratio for CVD hospitalizations: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.30; for non-CVD hospitalizations: 1.26; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.30) and an increase in the risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio for CVD mortality: 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.10; for non-CVD mortality: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.29). Age-standardized mortality risk at 1 year was 35.6% (95% CI, 35.1% to 36.1%) in the type 2 diabetes group vs 29.2% (95% CI, 29.0% to 29.5%) in the group with no diabetes. During the study period (ie, 1998 to 2017), associations of type 2 diabetes with hospitalization and mortality rates decreased for CVD outcomes but not for non-CVD outcomes. Age-adjusted hospitalization rates during the first year following HF diagnosis increased similarly for both groups over time (eg, HF with type 2 diabetes, 1998 to 2001: 133.3 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 102.2 to 105.4 per 100 person-years; 2012 to 2015: 152.5 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 145.5 to 159.5 per 100 person-years; P for difference in trend = .06), but trends diverged by cause. For example, hospitalizations for HF decreased for patients with type 2 diabetes at approximately the same annual rate (-2.2%; 95% CI, -3.9% to -0.5%) as they increased for those without diabetes (1.7%; 95% CI, 1.1% to 2.3%; P for difference in trend < .001). After 2004, a trend emerged showing a greater increase in non-CVD admissions among patients with HF and type 2 diabetes than among patients with no diabetes (2.3% [95% CI, 0.9% to 3.6%] vs 1.1% [95% CI, 0.8% to 1.4%]). In contrast to hospitalization rates, mortality rates reduced over time in both groups, but the reduction was greater among those with type 2 diabetes than without (-1.4% [95% CI, -1.8% to -0.9%] vs -0.7% [95% CI, -1.2% to -0.2%]; P for difference in trend < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the higher risk of all cause-specific outcomes and emerging non-CVD trends associated with patients with type 2 diabetes who experienced HF indicated an urgent need for earlier comorbidity management and patient-centered multimorbidity care.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31790564">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The improvement of QRS-T angle as a manifestation of reverse electrical remodeling following renal transplantation in end-stage kidney disease patients on haemodialysis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Successful renal transplantation (RT) reverses some of the cardiac changes and reduces cardiac mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Widened QRS-T angle reflects both ventricular repolarization and depolarization. It is considered a sensitive and strong predictor of heart ventricular remodeling as well as a powerful and independent risk stratifier suitable in predicting cardiac events in various clinical settings. The study aimed to assess the influence of the RT on QRS-T angle and to evaluate factors influencing QRS-T changes in renal transplanted recipients (RTRs).
METHODS: Fifty-four selected HD patients who have undergone RT were included. Blood chemistry, echocardiography, and QRS-T angle were evaluated 5 times: about 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 3 years after RT.
RESULTS: An improvement of echocardiographic parameters was observed. The dynamics of changes in individual parameters were, however, variable. QRS-T angle correlated with echocardiographic parameters. The biphasic pattern of the decreases of QRS-T angle was observed. The first decrease took place in the third month of follow-up. The second decrease of QRS-T angle was observed after 1 year of follow-up. The QRS-T angle was higher in RTRs compared with controls during each evaluation. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the decrease of left ventricle enddiastolic volume was an independent predictor of early QRS-T angle improvement. The increase of left ventricle ejection fraction was found to be the independent predictor of the late QRS-T angle improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: RT induces biphasic reverse electrical remodeling as assessed by the narrowing of QRS-T angle. Early decrease of QRS-T angle is mainly due to the normalization of volume status, whereas late decrease is associated predominantly with the improvement of cardiac contractile function.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31791259">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Protective effects of Salidroside on cardiac function in mice with myocardial infarction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Salidroside (SAL) is the major ingredient of Rhodiola rosea, and has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for decades. Numerous studies have demonstrated the protective effects of SAL for myocardial ischemia. However, it is yet to be deciphered whether SAL has cardioprotective effects after myocardial infarction (MI) in vivo. In the present study, we established a mouse MI model via coronary artery ligation. The aim was to investigate whether SAL treatment could reduce mortality, improve cardiac function and attenuate myocardial remodeling in MI mice. Post-surgery, mice were randomly administered SAL or normal saline. After 21 days, SAL was found to significantly reduce mortality, improve cardiac function, reduce fibrosis and infarct size compared to normal saline. In addition, oral administration of SAL could attenuate myocardial inflammation and apoptosis and promote angiogenesis. SAL down-regulated the expression levels of TNF-α, TGF-β1, IL-1β, Bax and up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, VEGF, Akt and eNOS. These results indicated that SAL could alleviate the pathological processes of myocardial remodeling in MI mice, and may be a potentially effective therapeutic approach for the management of clinical ischemic cardiovascular diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31792327">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Landscape of heart proteome changes in a diet-induced obesity model.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Obesity is a pandemic associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease; however, the mechanisms are not fully elucidated.

Thus, our study evaluated myocardial protein expression in healthy and obese rats, employing two proteomic approaches. Male Wistar rats were established in two groups (n = 13/group): control diet and Western diet fed for 41 weeks. Obesity was determined by the adipose index, and cardiac function was evaluated in vivo by echocardiogram and in vitro by isolated papillary muscle analysis. Proteomics was based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) along with mass spectrometry identification, and shotgun proteomics with label-free quantification. The Western diet was efficient in triggering obesity and impaired contractile function in vitro; however, no cardiac dysfunction was observed in vivo. The combination of two proteomic approaches was able to increase the cardiac proteomic map and to identify 82 differentially expressed proteins involved in different biological processes, mainly metabolism. Furthermore, the data also indicated a cardiac alteration in fatty acids transport, antioxidant defence, cytoskeleton, and proteasome complex, which have not previously been associated with obesity. Thus, we define a robust alteration in the myocardial proteome of diet-induced obese rats, even before functional impairment could be detected in vivo by echocardiogram.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31792287">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Global longitudinal strain can predict heart failure exacerbation in stable outpatients with ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in pharmacological and device-based treatment, heart failure (HF) continues to impose an enormous burden for health care system worldwide. Decompensation of HF is one of the main causes of hospitalization, therefore the identification of patients with the highest risk of such complication is still of great clinical importance. The prognostic significance and utility of global longitudinal strain (GLS) has been previously studied in patients with the broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in various endpoints, however its role in assessing the risk of hospitalization due to HF exacerbation of optimally treated outpatients has not been fully explored. Therefore, the aim of the study was to verify whether the GLS of the left ventricle (LV) derived by 2D speckle tracking echocardiography has, independently of other well-known clinical parameters, an additional impact on the risk of HF decompensation in stable patients with LV systolic dysfunction of ischemic origin.
METHODS: In 193 clinically stable HF outpatients with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%, GLS, additionally to other clinical parameters, was analyzed. During 34 (14-71) months of follow-up, 58 patients were hospitalized due to HF decompensation (EVENT).
RESULTS: EVENT was significantly associated with age, QRS width, NYHA functional class, left atrium diameter, LV systolic and diastolic volume, LVEF, hemoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide, diuretic treatment, absence of beta-blockers, impaired renal function and history of diabetes in univariate Cox analyzes. GLS with pre-specified cut-off value of -9.4% was also significantly associated with the EVENT (HR 15.16; 95% CI 1.81-126.91). After adjusting for above-mentioned parameters GLS was still a significant predictor of hospitalization due to HF decompensation.
CONCLUSIONS: GLS measurement can provide incremental information on the risk of HF decompensation in stable outpatients with LV systolic dysfunction of ischemic origin.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31790492">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Clinical outcomes and mortality in old and very old patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> AIM: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a valid therapeutic option for patients with heart failure (HF). However, the elderly population was not well represented in the guidelines. The primary end point was to evaluate the impact of advanced age on clinical response and cardiovascular and total mortality of patients undergoing CRT. The secondary end point was to assess the rate of acute complications related to the procedure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 249 consecutive patients with HF and optimized treatment, QRS ≥ 120 ms, ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35% and functional class (FC) III/ IV (NYHA) underwent CRT and divided into 3 groups: Group I-< 65 years-88/ 249 (35%); Group II- 65 to 75 years (old)- 72/ 249 (29%); Group III-≥ 75 years (very old)- 89/ 249 (36%). The improvement in FC and increase in EF (>10%) and/ or decrease in the left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) >15% were the criteria of responsiveness. The favorable clinical response (p = ns) and cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.737) was similar in the 3 groups. In the group of very old patients, a significant increase in total mortality was observed (p = 0.03). The rate of acute complications related to the procedure did not differ between the groups (p = ns).
CONCLUSION: The response to CRT and cardiovascular mortality were not affected by the advanced age and should not be an exclusion factor of this therapy. The procedure has been shown to be safe in elderly patients due to low rate of acute complications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31790460">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Interplay between Exosomes and Autophagy in Cardiovascular Diseases: Novel Promising Target for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Application.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Exosome, is identified as a nature nanocarrier and intercellular messenger that regulates cell to cell communication.

In this study we describe the echocardiographic evaluations of asymptomatic US Air Force members who were diagnosed with HIV infection and evaluated at the San Antonio Military Medical Center between September 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 50) were predominantly male (96%), mostly African American (60%), with a mean age of 28 years.

We examined the effects of smoking in patients with acute HF using data from a large multicenter registry. The objective was to determine if the design and analytic approach could explain the smoker's paradox in acute HF mortality. Methods and Results The data were sourced from the acute HF registry (Gulf CARE [Gulf Acute Heart Failure Registry]), a multicenter registry that recruited patients over 10 months admitted with a diagnosis of acute HF from 47 hospitals in 7 Middle Eastern countries. The association between smoking and mortality (in hospital) was examined using covariate adjustment, making use of mortality risk factors. A parallel analysis was performed using covariate balancing through propensity scores. Of 5005 patients hospitalized with acute HF, 1103 (22%) were current smokers. The in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower in current smoker's before (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96) and more so after (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.70) covariate adjustment. With the propensity score-derived covariate balance, the smoking effect became much less certain (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36-1.11). Conclusions The current study illustrates the fact that the smoker's paradox is likely to be a result of residual confounding as covariate adjustment may not resolve this if there are many competing prognostic confounders. In this situation, propensity score methods for covariate balancing seem preferable. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Their cardioprotective effects have been reported but whether they prevent AF in T2DM patients are less well-explored. We tested the hypothesis that the SGLT-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, can prevent atrial remodeling in a diabetic rat model.
METHODS: High-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) treatment were used to induce T2DM. A total of 96 rats were randomized into the following four groups: (i) control (ii) T2DM, (iii) low-dose empagliflozin (10 mg/kg/day)/T2DM; and (iv) high-dose empagliflozin (30 mg/kg/day)/T2DM by the intragastric route for 8 weeks.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, left atrial diameter, interstitial fibrosis and the incidence of AF inducibility were significantly increased in the DM group. Moreover, atrial mitochondrial respiratory function, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial biogenesis were impaired. Empagliflozin treatment significantly prevented the development of these abnormalities in DM rats, likely via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)/nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)/mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin can ameliorate atrial structural and electrical remodeling as well as improve mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis in T2DM, hence may be potentially used in the prevention of T2DM-related atrial fibrillation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31779619">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> GLP-1 analog liraglutide-induced cardiac dysfunction due to energetic starvation in heart failure with non-diabetic dilated cardiomyopathy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) reduces cardiovascular events in diabetic patients; however, its counter-protective effects have also been suggested in patients with heart failure and the clear explanation for its mechanisms have not yet been offered.
METHODS: The effects of GLP-1 analog on cardiac function and energy metabolism, especially glycemic and lipid metabolisms were elucidated using non-diabetic J2N-k hamsters which showed spontaneous dilated cardiomyopathy. J2N-k hamsters were treated with PBS (HF group), low-dose (HF-L group) or high-dose liraglutide (HF-H group).
RESULTS: In failing heart, GLP-1 analog exerted further deteriorated cardiac function (e.g. positive and negative dP/dt; p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively) with overt fibrosis and cardiac enlargement (heart/body weight, 5.7 ± 0.2 in HF group versus 7.6 ± 0.2 in HF-H group; p = 0.02). The protein expression of cardiac muscles indicated the energy starvation status. Indirect calorimetry showed that failing hearts consumed higher energy and carbohydrate than normal hearts; moreover, this tendency was augmented by GLP-1 analog administration. Upon 10% glucose solution loading with GLP-1 analog administration (HF-H-G group) as complementary experiments, the cardiac function and fibrosis significantly ameliorated, whereas carbohydrate utilization augmented further and lipid utilization reduced more. The prognosis of HF-H-G group also significantly improved (p = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 analog caused the relative but desperate shortage of glycemic energy source for the failing cardiac muscles and it may restrict ATP synthesis, resulting in cardiac function deterioration. Therefore, appropriate energy supply and amount of carbohydrate intake should be carefully considered when administrating incretin-related drugs to patients with heart failure.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31779634">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dietary intervention reduces left atrial enlargement in dogs with early preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease: a blinded randomized controlled study in 36 dogs.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), the most common naturally-occurring heart disease in dogs, is associated with alterations in energy metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. Energy deprivation plays a causal role in the development of heart failure. This study was designed to determine if a cardiac protection blend (CPB) of nutrients containing medium-chain triglycerides as an alternative energy source, fish oil to reduce inflammation, antioxidants, and other key nutrients important to cardiac health and function could slow or prevent MMVD progression. Nineteen dogs with early stage MMVD and 17 breed-, age-, and sex-matched healthy dogs were enrolled for a 6-month blinded, placebo-controlled study. Dogs in each cardiac health group were randomly assigned to either control diet (CON) or CPB-supplemented diet. Echocardiography was performed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.
RESULTS: No changes were found in healthy dogs. While MMVD-CON dogs had an average 10% increase over baseline in left atrial diameter (LAD) and left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) at 6 months, MMVD-CPB dogs showed 3% decreases, resulting significant diet by time interactions (P = 0.037, P = 0.005, respectively). More MMVD-CON dogs progressed from stage B1 to B2 during the study. A positive correlation was found between 6-month changes in LAD and blood pressures in MMVD-CPB dogs (systolic: P = 0.050, diastolic: P = 0.035) but not MMVD-CON dogs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated efficacy of CPB-based dietary intervention in reducing LA size and mitral regurgitation, and in slowing or preventing the progression of early MMVD in dogs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775756">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Towards standardized postprocessing of global longitudinal strain by feature tracking - OptiStrain CMR-FT study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is an important prognostic biomarker. Its everyday clinical use is limited due to methodological and postprocessing diversity among the users and vendors. Standardization of postprocessing approaches may reduce the random operator-dependent variability, allowing for comparability of measurements despite the systematic vendor-related differences.
METHODS: We investigated the random component of variability in GLS measurements by optimization steps which incrementally improved observer reproducibility and agreement. Cine images in two-, three- and four-chamber-views were serially analysed by two independent observers using two different CMR-FT softwares. The disparity of outcomes after each series was systematically assessed after a number of stepwise adjustments which were shown to significantly reduce the inter-observer and intervendor bias, resulting standardized postprocessing approach. The final analysis was performed in 44 subjects (ischaemic heart disease n = 15, non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, n = 19, healthy controls, n = 10). All measurements were performed blind to the underlying group allocation and previous measurements. Inter- and intra-observer variability were tested using Bland-Altman analyses, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CVs).
RESULTS: Compared to controls, mean GLS was significantly lower in patients, as well as between the two subgroups (p < 0.01). These differences were accentuated by standardization procedures, with significant increase in Cohen's D and AUCs. The benefit of standardization was also evident through improved CV and ICC agreements between observers and the two vendors. Initial intra-observer variability CVs for GLS parameters were 7.6 and 4.6%, inter-observer variability CVs were 11 and 4.7%, for the two vendors, respectively. After standardization, intra- and interobserver variability CVs were 3.1 and 4.3%, and 5.2 and 4.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Standardization of GLS postprocessing helps to reduce the random component of variability, introduced by inconsistencies of and between observers, and also intervendor variability, but not the systematic inter-vendor bias due to differences in image processing algorithms. Standardization of GLS measurements is an essential step in ensuring the reliable quantification of myocardial deformation, and implementation of CMR-FT in clinical routine.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775656">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Acceptability, Feasibility and Preliminary Evaluation of a Novel, Personalised, Home-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Chronic Heart Failure (Active-at-Home-HF): a Pilot Study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> PURPOSE: Less than 10% of heart failure patients in the UK participate in cardiac rehabilitation programmes. The present pilot study evaluated feasibility, acceptability and physiological effects of a novel, personalised, home-based physical activity intervention in chronic heart failure.
METHODS: Twenty patients (68 ± 7 years old, 20% females) with stable chronic heart failure due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (31 ± 8 %) participated in a single-group, pilot study assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week personalised home-based physical activity intervention aiming to increase daily number of steps by 2000 from baseline (Active-at-Home-HF). Patients completed cardiopulmonary exercise testing with non-invasive gas exchange and haemodynamic measurements and quality of life questionnaire pre- and post-intervention. Patients were supported weekly via telephone and average weekly step count data collected using pedometers.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients were screened and 20 recruited into the study. Seventeen patients (85%) completed the intervention, and 15 (75%) achieved the target step count. Average step count per day increased significantly from baseline to 3 weeks by 2546 (5108 ± 3064 to 7654 ± 3849, P = 0.03, n = 17) and was maintained until week 12 (9022 ± 3942). Following completion of the intervention, no adverse events were recorded and quality of life improved by 4 points (26 ± 18 vs. 22 ± 19). Peak exercise stroke volume increased by 19% (127 ± 34 vs. 151 ± 34 m/beat, P = 0.05), while cardiac index increased by 12% (6.8 ± 1.5 vs. 7.6 ± 2.0 L/min/m
CONCLUSION: The Active-at-Home-HF intervention is feasible, acceptable and effective for increasing physical activity in CHF. It may lead to improvements in quality of life, exercise tolerance and haemodynamic function.

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and diagnostic and treatment options in patients with acute heart failure in the Delta region of Egypt and to explore the gap in the management in comparison to the international guidelines.
RESULTS: DELTA-HF is a prospective observational cohort registry for all consecutive patients with acute heart failure (AHF) who were admitted to three tertiary care cardiac centers distributed in the Delta region of Egypt. All patients were recruited in the period from April 2017 to May 2018, during which, data were collected and short-term follow-up was done. A total of 220 patients (65.5% were males with a median age of 61.5 years and 50.9% had acute decompensation on top of chronic heart failure) was enrolled in our registry. The risk factors for heart failure included rheumatic valvular heart disease (10.9%), smoking (65.3%), hypertension (48.2%), diabetes mellitus (42.7%), and coronary artery disease (28.2%). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was less than 40% in 62.6%. Etiologies of heart failure included ischemic heart disease (58.1%), valvular heart disease (16.3%), systemic hypertension (9.1%), and dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (15.5%). Exacerbating factors included infections (28.1%), acute coronary syndromes (25.5%), non-compliance to HF medications (19.6%), and non-compliance to diet (23.2%) in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients. None of our patients had been offered heart failure device therapy and only 50% were put on beta-blockers upon discharge. In-hospital, 30 days and 90 days all-cause mortality were 18.2%, 20.7%, and 26% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear gap in the management of patients with acute heart failure in the Delta region of Egypt with confirmed under-utilization of heart failure device therapy and under-prescription of guideline-directed medical therapies particularly beta-blockers. The short-term mortality is high if compared with Western and other local registries. This could be attributed mainly to the low-resource health care system in this region and the lack of formal heart failure management programs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31773423">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus patients in South Africa have high prevalence and severity of cardiac and vascular manifestations.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Pediatric onset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with major organ involvement, and African patients tend to develop more aggressive disease than patients of European descent. Although cardiovascular involvement is common in pediatric SLE, there are few published reports on the subject. This study describes the frequency and characteristics of cardiac and vascular manifestations of pediatric SLE in a multi-ethnic South African cohort.
METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic data were collected from pediatric SLE patients at two centers in Cape Town, South Africa. At the time of investigation, this cohort consisted of 93 participants diagnosed with SLE according to international classification criteria prior to the age of 19. Individuals with cardiac and/or vascular involvement were identified by retrospective chart review. Cardiac manifestations were defined as presence of pericardial effusion, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. Vascular manifestations included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sinus thrombosis, stroke, critical limb ischemia, cerebral vasculitis and systemic vasculitis. Statistical analysis was performed using R (v3.4.1).
RESULTS: Cardiac and vascular involvement was present in 47% of the cohort. Previous studies have reported prevalence of 5%-50%. Demographic features of those with cardiac/vascular involvement did not differ from the overall cohort. Echocardiographic data were available for 23 participants. The most common cardiac manifestations were pericardial effusion (n = 24) and cardiac failure (n = 8), while the most common vascular manifestations were cerebral vasculitis (n = 9), stroke (n = 7), and pulmonary embolism (n = 7). Cardiovascular manifestations were frequently severe; one third of pericardial effusion cases required intervention, including three cases of cardiac tamponade. Cardiac and vascular involvement conferred an increased risk of mortality (31.1% versus 10.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac and vascular involvement were highly prevalent in this South African cohort. The mortality rate was high, and severe manifestations were frequent.

We compared outcomes of TAVI patients with low stroke volume index (SVI) ≤35 ml/m2 body surface area in different HF classes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients treated by transfemoral TAVI at our center (n = 1822) were classified as 1) 'HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF)' (HFpEF, EF ≥50%), 2) 'HF with mid-range EF' (HFmrEF, EF 40-49%), or 3) 'HF with reduced EF' (HFrEF, EF <40%). Patients with SVI >35 ml/m2 served as controls. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease and symptoms increased stepwise from controls (n = 968) to patients with HFpEF (n = 591), HFmrEF (n = 97), and HFrEF (n = 166). Mortality tended to be highest in HFrEF patients 30 days post-procedure, and it became significant after one year: 10.2% (controls), 13.5% (HFpEF), 13.4% (HFmrEF), and 23.5% (HFrEF). However, symptomatic improvement in survivors of all groups was achieved in the majority of patients without differences among groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AS and HF benefit from TAVI with respect to symptom alleviation. TAVI in patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF led to an identical, favorable post-procedural prognosis that was significantly better than that of patients with HFrEF, which remains a high-risk population.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31770401">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Lamotrigine-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a case report.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare hematological syndrome characterized by excessive and uncontrolled activation of the immune system. The often nonspecific nature of early symptoms and the potential for progression to multiorgan failure and death if appropriate therapy is not started promptly, highlight the importance of heightened recognition for this uncommon disease. Although there are well-described associations of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with infectious, malignant, and autoimmune diseases and an established treatment protocol for these cases, the link between medications and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is less clearly established and the optimal treatment of these cases less well defined.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe the case of a 45-year-old caucasian woman presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, induced by recent exposure to lamotrigine. She had a rapidly progressive clinical course, complicated by multiorgan failure including stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest. With dexamethasone and etoposide therapy, she made a full and sustained recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that medication-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis appears to respond similarly to the same dexamethasone and etoposide treatment regimen developed for other non-drug-induced forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. With the continued cessation of the offending agent there has not been need for maintenance therapy and no relapse to date. In addition, given the risk for cardiomyopathy, a clinical complication not classically associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, echocardiogram and telemetry monitoring should be considered in the initial workup of suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767022">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Risk Stratification for Sudden Cardiac Death in Non-Ischaemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) occurs in 1 in 2500 individuals in the general population and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Studies involving large numbers of unselected DCM patients have led to consensus guidelines recommending implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for protection against sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those with LVEF ≤35%. The purpose of this article is to review the literature for other potential markers including serological, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, cardiac magnetic resonance, ambulatory ECG and genetic data, to highlight other potential markers that may optimise risk stratification for SCD in this cohort and thereby allow a more personalized approach to ICD-implantation.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies including the Danish study to assess the efficacy of ICDs in patients with non-ischemic systolic heart failure on mortality (DANISH) trial have questioned the benefits of ICD implantation in this group of patients with no changes in all-cause mortality. Recent pooled cohorts of patients with genetic DCM and in particular in those with Lamin A/C (LMNA) mutations have identified patients at increased risk of SCD and allowed the creation of algorithms to prognosticate SCD risk in mutation carriers. Furthermore, genetic testing has identified other DCM-causing genes including filamin C (FLNC) and RBM20 which may be associated with higher rates of ventricular arrhythmia. To date, risk-stratification for SCD has been hampered by the utilisation of heterogenous subsets of idiopathic DCM patients and by use of static risk models where predictions are based on a single time point with a lack of consideration of disease progression. The current focus of personalised risk-stratification for SCD is shifting towards better characterisation of underlying DCM aetiology and the development of multi-parametric risk-stratification models that incorporate time-dependent disease characteristics and novel biomarkers.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768884">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The relative contributions of myocardial perfusion, blood volume and extracellular volume to native T1 and native T2 at rest and during adenosine stress in normal physiology.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Both ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease can cause disturbances in the myocardial blood volume (MBV), myocardial perfusion and the myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV). Recent studies suggest that native myocardial T1 mapping can detect changes in MBV during adenosine stress without the use of contrast agents. Furthermore, native T2 mapping could also potentially be used to quantify changes in myocardial perfusion and/or MBV. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relative contributions of myocardial perfusion, MBV and ECV to native T1 and native T2 at rest and during adenosine stress in normal physiology.
METHODS: Healthy subjects (n = 41, 26 ± 5 years, 51% females) underwent 1.5 T cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scanning. Quantitative myocardial perfusion [ml/min/g] and MBV [%] maps were computed from first pass perfusion imaging at adenosine stress (140 microg/kg/min infusion) and rest following an intravenous contrast bolus (0.05 mmol/kg, gadobutrol). Native T1 and T2 maps were acquired before and during adenosine stress. T1 maps at rest and stress were also acquired following a 0.2 mmol/kg cumulative intravenous contrast dose, rendering rest and stress ECV maps [%]. Myocardial T1, T2, perfusion, MBV and ECV values were measured by delineating a region of interest in the midmural third of the myocardium.
RESULTS: During adenosine stress, there was an increase in myocardial native T1, native T2, perfusion, MBV, and ECV (p ≤ 0.001 for all). Myocardial perfusion, MBV and ECV all correlated with both native T1 and native T2, respectively (R
CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial native T1, native T2, perfusion, MBV, and ECV all increase during adenosine stress. Changes in myocardial native T1 and T2 during adenosine stress in normal physiology can largely be explained by the combined changes in myocardial perfusion and ECV.

We sought to evaluate the utility of digoxin in LVAD recipients and its association with outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 505 patients who underwent continuous-flow LVAD implantation at 5 centers from 2007-2015 were included. Patients were divided into 4 groups: not on digoxin at any time (ND; n = 257), received digoxin pre implant (PreD; n = 144), received digoxin pre and post implant (ContD; n = 55), and received digoxin only post implant (PostD; n = 49).

MTWA at the end of surgery was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in both univariate analysis (OR = 27.378, 95% CI 5.616-133.466, p < 0.001) and multivariate analysis (OR = 59.225, 95% CI 6.061-578.748, p < 0.001).

Controlled trials provide new evidence on the effectiveness and safety of rhythm control therapy, particularly in patients with AF and heart failure. This review summarizes evidence supporting the use of rhythm control therapy in patients with AF for different outcomes, discusses implications for indications, and highlights remaining clinical gaps in evidence. Rhythm control therapy improves symptoms and quality of life in patients with symptomatic AF and can be safely delivered in elderly patients with comorbidities (mean age 70 years, 3-7% complications at 1 year). Atrial fibrillation ablation maintains sinus rhythm more effectively than antiarrhythmic drug therapy, but recurrent AF remains common, highlighting the need for better patient selection (precision medicine). Antiarrhythmic drugs remain effective after AF ablation, underpinning the synergistic mechanisms of action of AF ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs. Atrial fibrillation ablation appears to improve left ventricular function in a subset of patients with AF and heart failure. Data on the prognostic effect of rhythm control therapy are heterogeneous without a clear signal for either benefit or harm. Rhythm control therapy has acceptable safety and improves quality of life in patients with symptomatic AF, including in elderly populations with stroke risk factors. There is a clinical need to better stratify patients for rhythm control therapy.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) shares a predilection for women, can result in left ventricular wall motion abnormalities similar to TTS, and may manifest subtle angiographic findings. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of SCAD misdiagnosed as TTS. Methods and Results Coronary angiograms of patients presenting with a provisional diagnosis of TTS were retrospectively reviewed by an independent expert blinded to left ventriculography and the specific purpose of the study to assess for SCAD. TTS was defined using European Society for Cardiology criteria. SCAD was categorized according to the Saw angiographic classification. Among 80 women with a provisional diagnosis of TTS, 2 (2.5%) met angiographic criteria for definite SCAD. Both dissections were located in the distal left anterior descending coronary artery and classified as type 2b. The wall motion abnormality was apical in both cases. An additional 7 patients (9%) had angiography that was indeterminate for SCAD. Clinical characteristics of patients with and without SCAD were similar. Conclusions Among patients with a provisional diagnosis of TTS, definite SCAD in the left anterior descending coronary artery was present in 2.5% of cases, and coronary angiography was indeterminate for SCAD in an additional 9%. Careful review of coronary angiography may avoid missed diagnoses of SCAD in patients with myocardial infarction, nonobstructive coronary arteries, and wall motion abnormalities consistent with TTS.

Because patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) might have abnormal right atrial and ventricular mechanics caused by myocardial injury and remodeling, we hypothesized that RAP would be associated with disease severity and cardiovascular adverse events in this population. Methods and Results We performed a cohort study of adults with TOF who underwent right heart catheterization at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1990 and 2017. The objective was to determine the association between RAP and multiple domains of disease severity in TOF (percentage of predicted peak oxygen consumption, atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, and heart failure hospitalization), as well as cardiovascular adverse events, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, resuscitated or aborted sudden death, heart transplantation, or death. Among 225 patients (113 male; mean age: 39±14 years), mean RAP was 10.7±5.2 mm Hg and median was 10 mm Hg (interquartile range: 7-13 mm Hg).

However, preoperative predictors of vasoplegia and its impact on survival after HT are unknown. We sought to examine predictors and outcomes of patients who develop vasoplegia after HT following bridging therapy with an LVAD. Methods and Results We identified 94 patients who underwent HT after bridging with continuous-flow LVAD from 2008 to 2018 at a single institution.

The rarity of these anomalies makes their diagnosis a formidable challenge. Variable arterial courses have been described. In this report, we present a case with unique arterial course, which starts as a hyperacute take-off of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the left main coronary artery (LMCA), with subsequent coursing, without external compression, between the right ventricular outflow tract and aorta. Our case is relevant to the concept of whether we should keep a reasonable index of suspicion for coronary artery anomalies during cardiac evaluations of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgeries.
Clinical case: This is an asymptomatic 47-year-old African American female who presented for cardiac clearance for renal transplantation. She had a past medical history of hypertension, bronchial asthma, and former smoking of 10 years (quitting 15 years prior to presentation). She also has end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. Cardiac workup revealed left ventricular hypertrophy on EKG, multi-chamber dilation seen on echo, and anomalous RCA course seen on CT coronary angiography. Cardiac catheterization revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease of the LCX and RCA. After consulting with cardiothoracic surgery, conservative medical management was decided based on the patient's risk stratification. She was advised to have close monitoring of her condition.
Discussion: Coronary artery anomalies represent the second most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. At this time, the prevalence of right coronary artery (RCA) take off from the left coronary sinus occurs at a percentage of 0.019% to 0.49%. The RCA origination from the left main coronary artery (LMCA) accounts for only 0.65% of these anomalies. Our patient had high-risk anatomy consisting of a hyper-angulated take-off of the RCA from the LMCA as well as course between the pulmonary artery and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). CT coronary angiography is the most useful imaging modality that characterizes coronary artery anomalies. Although this patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of cardiorespiratory compromise, she warranted a full cardiac workup preoperatively that incidentally revealed a coronary anomaly. Recognition of this disease is critical for timely prevention of potential complications as well as discussion of goals of care. Guidelines for medical versus surgical management are available, but the management strategy should be individualized, with the highest consideration given to risk-benefit analysis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-21<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633013">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Study of indications for cardiac device implantation and utilisation in Fabry cardiomyopathy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Fabry disease is a treatable X-linked condition leading to progressive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia and premature death. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias contribute significantly to adverse prognosis; however, guidance to determine which patients require cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is sparse. We aimed to evaluate indications for implantation practice in the UK and quantify device utilisation.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included demographic, clinical and imaging data from patients in four of the largest UK Fabry centres. Ninety patients with Fabry disease were identified with CIEDs implanted between June 2001 and February 2018 (FD-CIED group). To investigate differences in clinical and imaging markers between those with and without devices, these patients were compared with 276 patients without a CIED (FD-control).
RESULTS: In the FD-CIED group, 92% of patients with permanent pacemakers but only 28% with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators had a class 1 indication for implantation. A further 44% of patients had defibrillators inserted for primary prevention outside of current guidance. The burden of arrhythmia requiring treatment in the FD-CIED group was high (asymptomatic atrial fibrillation:29%; non-sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring medical therapy alone: 26%; sustained ventricular tachycardia needing anti-tachycardia pacing/defibrillation: 28%). Those with devices were older, had greater LV mass, more scar tissue and larger atrial size.
CONCLUSIONS: Arrhythmias are common in Fabry patients. Those with cardiac devices had high rates of atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation and ventricular arrhythmia needing device treatment. These are as high as those in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, supporting the need for Fabry-specific indications for device implantation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-25<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446426">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Evaluation of algorithms for Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation: An open-access grand challenge.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Knowledge of whole heart anatomy is a prerequisite for many clinical applications. Whole heart segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of the heart, can be very valuable for modeling and analysis of the anatomy and functions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can be challenging due to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of the clinical data. To achieve this goal, an initial set of training data is generally needed for constructing priors or for training. Furthermore, it is difficult to perform comparisons between different methods, largely due to differences in the datasets and evaluation metrics used. This manuscript presents the methodologies and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the submissions to the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provided 120 three-dimensional cardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes, all acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation. Ten algorithms for CT data and eleven algorithms for MRI data, submitted from twelve groups, have been evaluated. The results showed that the performance of CT WHS was generally better than that of MRI WHS. The segmentation of the substructures for different categories of patients could present different levels of challenge due to the difference in imaging and variations of heart shapes. The deep learning (DL)-based methods demonstrated great potential, though several of them reported poor results in the blinded evaluation. Their performance could vary greatly across different network structures and training strategies. The conventional algorithms, mainly based on multi-atlas segmentation, demonstrated good performance, though the accuracy and computational efficiency could be limited. The challenge, including provision of the annotated training data and the blinded evaluation for submitted algorithms on the test data, continues as an ongoing benchmarking resource via its homepage (www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/).<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-25<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446280">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Subclinical Myocardial Dysfunction Demonstrated by Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Children with Euthyroid Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis<br><b>Abstract:</b> Objective: Thyroid hormones have an important role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system.

METHODS: This investigation was carried out to determine the frequency of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes of TGF-β1 and IL-10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 57 Iranian patients with CHF compared with 140 healthy subjects using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers method.
RESULTS: Results of the analyzed data divulged a negative association for both TGF-β1 GC genotype at codon 25 (P=0.047) and CT genotype at codon 10 (P=0.018) and CHF proneness. Although, TGF-β1 CC genotype at codon 10 was found to be positively associated with CHF (P=0.011). Moreover, the frequency of IL-10 (-1082, -819, -592) ATA haplotype and TGF-β1 (codon 10, codon 25) TG haplotype were significantly lower in the patients group (P=0.004 and P=0.040, respectively), while TGF-β1 (codon 10, codon 25) CG haplotype was overrepresented in patients with CHF (P=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine gene polymorphisms might affect vulnerability to CHF.

The age-dependent senescence, the frailty-related stem cell depletion, chronic inflammation, imbalance of immune homeostasis, and the reduction of multipotent stem cells collectively suggest the rational hypothesis that it is possible to (partially) cure frailty with stem cells. This systematic review has included all of the human trials of stem cell therapy for frailty from the main electronic databases and printed materials and screened the closely related reviews themed on the mechanisms of aging, frailty, and stem cells, to provide more insights in stem cell strategies for frailty, one promising method to recover health from a frail status. To date, a total of four trials about this subject have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), doses of 100 million cells, single peripheral intravenous infusion, follow-up periods of 6-12 months, and a focus primarily on safety and secondarily on efficacy are common characteristics of these studies. We conclude that intravenous infusion of allogenic MSCs is safe, well tolerated, and preliminarily effective clinically. More preclinical experiments and clinical trials are warranted to precisely elucidate the mechanism, safety, and efficacy of frailty stem cell therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-01-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30693831">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6920742/">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6913300/">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6913253/">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6913810/">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6903437/">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6909820/">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6906161/">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Methods for accelerated and enhanced cardiac differentiation of IPS cells by electrical stimulation<br><b>Abstract:</b> Methods of generating cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) are provided.
