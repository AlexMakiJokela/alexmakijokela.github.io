Central to the biogenesis, content, and function of EVs are their delimiting lipid bilayer membranes. To evaluate research progress on membranes and EVs, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) conducted a workshop in March 2018 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, bringing together key opinion leaders and hands-on researchers who were selected on the basis of submitted applications. The workshop was accompanied by two scientific surveys and covered four broad topics: EV biogenesis and release; EV uptake and fusion; technologies and strategies used to study EV membranes; and EV transfer and functional assays. In this ISEV position paper, we synthesize the results of the workshop and the related surveys to outline important outstanding questions about EV membranes and describe areas of consensus. The workshop discussions and survey responses reveal that while much progress has been made in the field, there are still several concepts that divide opinion. Good consensus exists in some areas, including particular aspects of EV biogenesis, uptake and downstream signalling. Areas with little to no consensus include EV storage and stability, as well as whether and how EVs fuse with target cells. Further research is needed in these key areas, as a better understanding of membrane biology will contribute substantially towards advancing the field of extracellular vesicles.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Ashley E Russell, Alexandra Sneider, Kenneth W Witwer, Paolo Bergese, Suvendra N Bhattacharyya, Alexander Cocks, Emanuele Cocucci, Uta Erdbrügger, Juan M Falcon-Perez, David W Freeman, Thomas M Gallagher, Shuaishuai Hu, Yiyao Huang, Steven M Jay, Shin-Ichi Kano, Gregory Lavieu, Aleksandra Leszczynska, Alicia M Llorente, Quan Lu, Vasiliki Mahairaki, Dillon C Muth, Nicole Noren Hooten, Matias Ostrowski, Ilaria Prada, Susmita Sahoo, Tine Hiorth Schøyen, Lifu Sheng, Deanna Tesch, Guillaume Van Niel, Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke, Frederik J Verweij, Ana V Villar, Marca Wauben, Ann M Wehman, Hang Yin, David Raul Francisco Carter, Pieter Vader<br><b>Journal:</b> J Extracell Vesicles<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2001-3078<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 10.65<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.283<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31762963">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The microbiota regulates murine inflammatory responses to toxin-induced CNS demyelination but has minimal impact on remyelination.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The microbiota is now recognized as a key influence on the host immune response in the central nervous system (CNS). As such, there has been some progress toward therapies that modulate the microbiota with the aim of limiting immune-mediated demyelination, as occurs in multiple sclerosis. However, remyelination-the regeneration of myelin sheaths-also depends upon an immune response, and the effects that such interventions might have on remyelination have not yet been explored. Here, we show that the inflammatory response during CNS remyelination in mice is modulated by antibiotic or probiotic treatment, as well as in germ-free mice. We also explore the effect of these changes on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation, which is inhibited by antibiotics but unaffected by our other interventions. These results reveal that high combined doses of oral antibiotics impair oligodendrocyte progenitor cell responses during remyelination and further our understanding of how mammalian regeneration relates to the microbiota.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Christopher E McMurran, Alerie Guzman de la Fuente, Rosana Penalva, Ofra Ben Menachem-Zidon, Yvonne Dombrowski, John Falconer, Ginez A Gonzalez, Chao Zhao, Fynn N Krause, Adam M H Young, Julian L Griffin, Clare A Jones, Claire Hollins, Markus M Heimesaat, Denise C Fitzgerald, Robin J M Franklin<br><b>Journal:</b> Proc.

Such knowledge of human neural circuits is difficult, at best, to obtain. Here, we study firing properties of human subthalamic neurons, using microelectrode recordings and microstimulation during awake surgery for Parkinson's disease. We demonstrate that low-amplitude, brief trains of microstimulation can lead to persistent changes in neuronal firing behavior including switching between firing rates, entering silent periods, or firing several bursts then entering a silent period. We suggest that these multistable states reflect properties of finite state machines and could have implications for the function of circuits involving the subthalamic nucleus. Furthermore, understanding these states could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed at regulating the transitions between states.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy W Chopek, Hans Hultborn, Robert M Brownstone<br><b>Journal:</b> Proc.

EVs enable intercellular communication by serving as delivery vehicles for a wide range of endogenous cargo molecules, such as RNAs, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. EVs have also been found to display tissue tropism mediated by surface molecules, such as integrins and glycans, making them promising for drug delivery applications. Various methods can be used to load therapeutic agents into EVs, and additional modification strategies have been employed to prolong circulation and improve targeting.

Inability to maintain lysosomal acidic pH is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms elicited by impaired lysosomal acidification remain poorly understood. We show here that inhibition of lysosomal acidification triggers cellular iron deficiency, which results in impaired mitochondrial function and non-apoptotic cell death. These effects are recovered by supplying iron via a lysosome-independent pathway. Notably, iron deficiency is sufficient to trigger inflammatory signaling in cultured primary neurons. Using a mouse model of impaired lysosomal acidification, we observed a robust iron deficiency response in the brain, verified by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, the brains of these mice present a pervasive inflammatory signature associated with instability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), both corrected by supplementation of the mice diet with iron. Our results highlight a novel mechanism linking impaired lysosomal acidification, mitochondrial malfunction and inflammation in vivo.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> King Faisal Yambire, Christine Rostosky, Takashi Watanabe, David Pacheu-Grau, Sylvia Torres-Odio, Angela Sanchez-Guerrero, Ola Senderovich, Esther G Meyron-Holtz, Ira Milosevic, Jens Frahm, A Phillip West, Nuno Raimundo<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31793879">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Chronic nigral neuromodulation aggravates behavioral deficits and synaptic changes in an α-synuclein based rat model for Parkinson's disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) is the pathological hallmark of several diseases named synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), which is the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder. Alpha-SYN has been linked to synaptic function both in physiological and pathological conditions. However, the exact link between neuronal activity, α-SYN toxicity and disease progression in PD is not clear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of chronic neuromodulation in an α-SYN-based rat model for PD using chemogenetics. To do this, we expressed excitatory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) combined with mutant A53T α-SYN, using two different recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors (serotypes 2/7 and 2/8) in rat substantia nigra (SN) and investigated the effect on motor behavior, synapses and neuropathology. We found that chronic neuromodulation aggravates motor deficits induced by α-SYN, without altering dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In addition, neuronal activation led to changes in post-translational modification and subcellular localization of α-SYN, linking neuronal activity to the pathophysiological role of α-SYN in PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Teresa Torre-Muruzabal, Jens Devoght, Chris Van den Haute, Bert Brône, Anke Van der Perren, Veerle Baekelandt<br><b>Journal:</b> Acta Neuropathol Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2051-5960<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.93<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.279<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640762">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The many substrates and functions of NEDD4-1.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and prognosis are highly related to gene alterations and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Ubiquitination is a critical PTM that governs practically all aspects of cellular function. An increasing number of studies show that E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) are important enzymes in the process of ubiquitination that primarily determine substrate specificity and thus need to be tightly controlled. Among E3s, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-1 (NEDD4-1) has been shown to play a critical role in modulating the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells and the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer therapies via regulating multiple substrates. This review discusses some significant discoveries on NEDD4-1 substrates and the signaling pathways in which NEDD4-1 participates. In addition, we introduce the latest potential therapeutic strategies that inhibit or activate NEDD4-1 activity using small molecules. NEDD4-1 likely acts as a novel drug target or diagnostic marker in the battle against cancer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Xi Huang, Jing Chen, Wen Cao, Li Yang, Qingxiao Chen, Jingsong He, Qing Yi, He Huang, Enfan Zhang, Zhen Cai<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Death Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-4889<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.310<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31787758">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficient Delivery of MicroRNA and AntimiRNA Molecules Using an Argininocalix[4]arene Macrocycle.<br><b>Abstract:</b> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules acting as gene regulators by repressing translation or by inducing degradation of the target RNA transcripts. Altered expression of miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of many severe human diseases, opening new avenues in the field of therapeutic strategies, i.e., miRNA targeting or miRNA mimicking. In this context, the efficient and non-toxic delivery of premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules might be of great interest. The aim of the present paper is to determine whether an argininocalix[4]arene is able to efficiently deliver miRNA, premiRNA, and antimiRNA molecules to target cells, preserving their biological activity. This study points out that (1) the toxicity of argininocalix[4]arene 1 is low, and it can be proposed for long-term treatment of target cells, being that this feature is a pre-requisite for the development of therapeutic protocols; (2) the delivery of premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules is efficient, being higher when compared with reference gold standards available; and (3) the biological activity of the premiRNAs and antimiRNAs is maintained. This was demonstrated using the argininocalix[4]arene 1 in miRNA therapeutic approaches performed on three well-described experimental model systems: (1) the induction of apoptosis by antimiR-221 in glioma U251 cells; (2) the induction of apoptosis by premiR-124 in U251 cells; and (3) the inhibition of pro-inflammatory IL-8 and IL-6 genes in cystic fibrosis IB3-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that the argininocalix[4]arene 1 should be considered a very useful delivery system for efficient transfer to target cells of both premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules, preserving their biological activity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Gasparello, Michela Lomazzi, Chiara Papi, Elisabetta D'Aversa, Francesco Sansone, Alessandro Casnati, Gaetano Donofrio, Roberto Gambari, Alessia Finotti<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Nucleic Acids<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2162-2531<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.011<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31733592">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Latest advances in aging research and drug discovery.<br><b>Abstract:</b> An increasing aging population poses a significant challenge to societies worldwide. A better understanding of the molecular, cellular, organ, tissue, physiological, psychological, and even sociological changes that occur with aging is needed in order to treat age-associated diseases. The field of aging research is rapidly expanding with multiple advances transpiring in many previously disconnected areas. Several major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer companies made aging research a priority and are building internal expertise, integrating aging research into traditional business models and exploring new go-to-market strategies. Many of these efforts are spearheaded by the latest advances in artificial intelligence, namely deep learning, including generative and reinforcement learning. To facilitate these trends, the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen and Insilico Medicine are building a community of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in these areas and launched the annual conference series titled "Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD)" held in the capital of the pharmaceutical industry, Basel, Switzerland (www.agingpharma.org).

To date, the examples of the successful use of multicistronic vectors have been described for the development of new methods of treatment of various human diseases, including cardiovascular, oncological, metabolic, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders. The safety and effectiveness of the joint delivery of therapeutic genes in multicistronic vectors based on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and self-cleaving 2A peptides have been shown in both in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as in clinical trials. Co-expression of several genes in one vector has also been used to create animal models of various inherited diseases which are caused by mutations in several genes. Multicistronic vectors provide expression of all mutant genes, which allows the most complete mimicking disease pathogenesis.

Since they can be generated from any healthy person or patient, iPSCs are considered as a valuable resource for regenerative medicine to replace diseased or damaged tissues. In addition, reprogramming technology has provided a powerful tool to study mechanisms of cell fate decisions and to model human diseases, thereby substantially potentiating the possibility to (i) discover new drugs in screening formats and (ii) treat life-threatening diseases through cell therapy-based strategies. However, various legal and ethical barriers arise when aiming to exploit the full potential of iPSCs to minimize abuse or unauthorized utilization. In this review, we discuss bioethical, legal, and societal concerns associated with research and therapy using iPSCs.

Among them, the HBB IVS2-654 (C > T) mutation, which is in the intron, creates an aberrant splicing site. Bone marrow transplantation for curing β-thalassaemia is limited due to the lack of matched donors. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), as a widely used tool for gene editing, is able to target specific sequence and create double-strand break (DSB), which can be combined with the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) to correct mutations. In this study, according to two different strategies, the HBB IVS2-654 mutation was seamlessly corrected in iPSCs by CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN. To reduce the occurrence of secondary cleavage, a more efficient strategy was adopted. The corrected iPSCs kept pluripotency and genome stability. Moreover, they could differentiate normally. Through CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN, our study provides improved strategies for gene correction of β-Thalassaemia, and the expression of the HBB gene can be restored, which can be used for gene therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Xiong, Yingjun Xie, Yi Yang, Yanting Xue, Ding Wang, Shouheng Lin, Diyu Chen, Dian Lu, Lina He, Bing Song, Yinghong Yang, Xiaofang Sun<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

To date, in addition to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, gene delivery has emerged as a potential therapeutic modality for ovarian cancer. Efficient and safe targeted gene delivery is complicated due to the tumor heterogeneity barrier. Ultrasound (US)-stimulated microbubbles (MBs) have demonstrated a method of enabling non-invasive targeted gene delivery.
Purpose: The purpose of our study was to show the utility of poly(ethylene glycol)-SS-polyethylenimine-loaded microbubbles (PSP@MB) as an ultrasound theranostic and redox-responsive agent in a gene delivery system.
Patients and methods: PSP nanoparticles were conjugated to the MB surface through biotin-avidin linkage, increasing the gene-loading efficiency of MB. The significant increase in the release of genes from the PSP@MB complexes was achieved upon ultrasound exposure. The positive surface charge in PSP@MB can condense the plasmid through electrostatic interactions; agarose-gel electrophoresis further confirmed the ability of PSP@MB to condense plasmids. The morphology, particle sizes and zeta potential of PSP@MB were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering.
Results: Laser confocal microscopy showed that the combination of ultrasound with PSP@MB could promote the cellular uptake of plasmids. Plasmids which encode enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter genes or luciferase reporter genes were delivered to CSCs in vitro and to subcutaneous xenografts in vivo via the combination of ultrasound with PSP@MB. Gene transfection efficiency was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and In Vivo Imaging Systems. This study demonstrated that the combination of ultrasound with PSP@MB can remarkably promote gene delivery to solid tumors as well as diminishing the toxicity towards normal tissues in vivo. The combination of PSP@MB and the use of ultrasound can efficiently enhance accumulation, extravasation and penetration into solid tumors.
Conclusion: Taken together, our study showed that this novel PSP@MB and ultrasound-mediated gene delivery system could efficiently target CSCs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Chun Liufu, Yue Li, Jiawei Tu, Hui Zhang, Jinsui Yu, Yi Wang, Pintong Huang, Zhiyi Chen<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Nanomedicine<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-2013<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.54<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.098<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31814720">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Vitamin K1 As A Potential Molecule For Reducing Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes-Stimulated α-Synuclein Structural Changes And Cytotoxicity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Aims: Different kinds of vitamins can be used as promising candidates to mitigate the structural changes of proteins and associated cytotoxicity stimulated by NPs. Therefore, the structural changes of α-syn molecules and their associated cytotoxicity in the presence of SWCNTs either alone or co-incubated with vitamin K1 were studied by spectroscopic, bioinformatical, and cellular assays.
Methods: Intrinsic and ThT fluorescence, CD, and Congo red absorption spectroscopic approaches as well as TEM investigation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics were used to explore the protective effect of vitamin K1 on the structural changes of α-syn induced by SWCNTs. The cytotoxicity of α-syn/SWCNTs co-incubated with vitamin K1 against SH-SY5Y cells was also carried out by MTT, LDH, and caspase-3 assays.
Results: Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that vitamin K1 has a significant effect in reducing SWCNT-induced fluorescence quenching and aggregation of α- syn. CD, Congo red adsorption, and TEM investigations determined that co-incubation of α- syn with vitamin K1 inhibited the propensity of α-syn into the structural changes and amorphous aggregation in the presence of SWCNT. Docking studies determined the occupation of preferred docked site of SWCNT by vitamin K1 on α- syn conformation. A molecular dynamics study also showed that vitamin K1 reduced the structural changes of α- syn induced by SWCNT. Cellular data exhibited that the cytotoxicity of α- syn co-incubated with vitamin K1 in the presence of SWCNTs is less than the outcomes obtained in the absence of the vitamin K1.
Conclusion: It may be concluded that vitamin K1 decreases the propensity of α- syn aggregation in the presence of SWCNTs and induction of cytotoxicity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Amitis Naskhi, Sanaz Jabbari, Goran Qader Othman, Falah Mohammad Aziz, Abbas Salihi, Majid Sharifi, Soyar Sari, Keivan Akhtari, Shang Ziyad Abdulqadir, Asaad Ab Alasady, Osama K Abou-Zied, Anwarul Hasan, Mojtaba Falahati<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Nanomedicine<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-2013<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.54<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.098<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31749617">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunomodulatory Effects of Genetic Alterations Affecting the Kynurenine Pathway.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Several enzymes and metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (KP) have immunomodulatory effects. Modulation of the activities and levels of these molecules might be of particular importance under disease conditions when the amelioration of overreacting immune responses is desired. Results obtained by the use of animal and tissue culture models indicate that by eliminating or decreasing activities of key enzymes of the KP, a beneficial shift in disease outcome can be attained. This review summarizes experimental data of models in which IDO, TDO, or KMO activity modulation was achieved by interventions affecting enzyme production at a genomic level. Elimination of IDO activity was found to improve the outcome of sepsis, certain viral infections, chronic inflammation linked to diabetes, obesity, aorta aneurysm formation, and in anti-tumoral processes. Similarly, lack of TDO activity was advantageous in the case of anti-tumoral immunity, while KMO inhibition was found to be beneficial against microorganisms and in the combat against tumors, as well. On the other hand, the complex interplay among KP metabolites and immune function in some cases requires an increase in a particular enzyme activity for the desired immune response modulation, as was shown by the exacerbation of liver fibrosis due to the elimination of IDO activity and the detrimental effects of TDO inhibition in a mouse model of autoimmune gastritis. The relevance of these studies concerning possible human applications are discussed and highlighted.

Age-related dysregulation of microRNA biogenesis increases neuronal vulnerability to cellular stress and may contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. All major neurodegenerative disorders are also associated with oxidative stress, which is widely recognized as a potential target for protective therapies. Albeit often considered separately, microRNA networks and oxidative stress are inextricably entwined in neurodegenerative processes. Oxidative stress affects expression levels of multiple microRNAs and, conversely, microRNAs regulate many genes involved in an oxidative stress response. Both oxidative stress and microRNA regulatory networks also influence other processes linked to neurodegeneration, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulation of proteostasis, and increased neuroinflammation, which ultimately lead to neuronal death. Modulating the levels of a relatively small number of microRNAs may therefore alleviate pathological oxidative damage and have neuroprotective activity. Here, we review the role of individual microRNAs in oxidative stress and related pathways in four neurodegenerative conditions: Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), Huntington's (HD) disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We also discuss the problems associated with the use of oversimplified cellular models and highlight perspectives of studying microRNA regulation and oxidative stress in human stem cell-derived neurons.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Julia Konovalova, Dmytro Gerasymchuk, Ilmari Parkkinen, Piotr Chmielarz, Andrii Domanskyi<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31801298">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Advances in Sphingolipidoses: CRISPR-Cas9 Editing as an Option for Modelling and Therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sphingolipidoses are inherited genetic diseases characterized by the accumulation of glycosphingolipids. Sphingolipidoses (SP), which usually involve the loss of sphingolipid hydrolase function, are of lysosomal origin, and represent an important group of rare diseases among lysosomal storage disorders. Initial treatments consisted of enzyme replacement therapy, but, in recent decades, various therapeutic approaches have been developed. However, these commonly used treatments for SP fail to be fully effective and do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. New approaches, such as genome editing, have great potential for both the treatment and study of sphingolipidoses. Here, we review the most recent advances in the treatment and modelling of SP through the application of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. CRISPR-Cas9 is currently the most widely used method for genome editing. This technique is versatile; it can be used for altering the regulation of genes involved in sphingolipid degradation and synthesis pathways, interrogating gene function, generating knock out models, or knocking in mutations. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is being used as an approach to disease treatment, but more frequently it is utilized to create models of disease. New CRISPR-Cas9-based tools of gene editing with diminished off-targeting effects are evolving and seem to be more promising for the correction of individual mutations.

Currently, there is hope that stroke recovery might be promoted by cell-based therapies. The field of stem cell therapy for cerebral ischemia has made significant progress in the last five years. A variety of stem cells have been tested in animal models and humans including adipose stem cells, human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, human amnion epithelial cells, human placenta amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells, adult human pluripotent-like olfactory stem cells, human bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells, electrically-stimulated human neuronal progenitor cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of human origin. Combination therapies in animal models include a mix of two or more therapeutic factors consisting of bone marrow stromal cells, exercise and thyroid hormones, endothelial progenitor cells overexpressing the chemokine CXCL12. Mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of transplanted cells include the "bystander" effects, paracrine mechanisms, or extracellular vesicles-mediated restorative effects.

The structural divergence of self-assembling peptides allows for various functional possibilities; when assembled, they can be used as scaffolds for cell and tissue regeneration, and vehicles for drug delivery, conferring controlled release, stability, and targeting, and avoiding side effects of drugs. These peptides can also be used as drugs themselves. In this review, we describe the basic structure and characteristics of self-assembling peptides and the various factors that affect the formation of peptide-based structures. We also summarize the applications of self-assembling peptides in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer.

The concept of cell encapsulation was first proposed almost nine decades ago, however, and despite its potential, the technology has yet to deliver its promise. The few clinical trials based on cell encapsulation have not led to any licensed therapies. Progress in the field has been slow, in part due to the complexity of the technology, but also because of the difficulties encountered when trying to prevent the immune responses generated by the various microcapsule components, namely the polymer, the encapsulated cells, the therapeutic transgenes and the DNA vectors used to genetically engineer encapsulated cells. While the immune responses induced by polymers such as alginate can be minimized using highly purified materials, the need to cope with the immunogenicity of encapsulated cells is increasingly seen as key in preventing the immune rejection of microcapsules. The encapsulated cells are recognized by the host immune cells through a bidirectional exchange of immune mediators, which induce both the adaptive and innate immune responses against the engrafted capsules. The potential strategies to cope with the immunogenicity of encapsulated cells include the selective diffusion restriction of immune mediators through capsule pores and more recently inclusion in microcapsules of immune modulators such as CXCL12. Combining these strategies with the use of well-characterized cell lines harboring the immunomodulatory properties of stem cells should encourage the incorporation of cell encapsulation technology in state-of-the-art drug development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Assem Ashimova, Sergey Yegorov, Baurzhan Negmetzhanov, Gonzalo Hortelano<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Bioeng Biotechnol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2296-4185<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.248<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31850335">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nano-Enhanced Drug Delivery and Therapeutic Ultrasound for Cancer Treatment and Beyond.<br><b>Abstract:</b> While ultrasound is most widely known for its use in diagnostic imaging, the energy carried by ultrasound waves can be utilized to influence cell function and drug delivery. Consequently, our ability to use ultrasound energy at a given intensity unlocks the opportunity to use the ultrasound for therapeutic applications. Indeed, in the last decade ultrasound-based therapies have emerged with promising treatment modalities for several medical conditions. More recently, ultrasound in combination with nanomedicines, i.e., nanoparticles, has been shown to have substantial potential to enhance the efficacy of many treatments including cancer, Alzheimer disease or osteoarthritis. The concept of ultrasound combined with drug delivery is still in its infancy and more research is needed to unfold the mechanisms and interactions of ultrasound with different nanoparticles types and with various cell types.

Notably, this review discusses the application of high intensity focus ultrasound for non-invasive tumor ablation and immunomodulatory effects of ultrasound, as well as the efficacy of nanoparticle-enhanced ultrasound therapies for different medical conditions.

Even though peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) are capable of some degree of regeneration, frail recovery is seen even when the best microsurgical technique is applied. PNIs are known to be very incapacitating for the patient, due to the deprivation of motor and sensory abilities. Since there is no optimal solution for tackling this problem up to this day, the evolution in the field is constant, with innovative designs of advanced nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) being reported every day. As a basic concept, a NGC should act as a physical barrier from the external environment, concomitantly acting as physical guidance for the regenerative axons across the gap lesion. NGCs should also be able to retain the naturally released nerve growth factors secreted by the damaged nerve stumps, as well as reducing the invasion of scar tissue-forming fibroblasts to the injury site. Based on the neurobiological knowledge related to the events that succeed after a nerve injury, neuronal subsistence is subjected to the existence of an ideal environment of growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) factors. Therefore, it is known that multifunctional NGCs fabricated through combinatorial approaches are needed to improve the functional and clinical outcomes after PNIs. The present work overviews the current reports dealing with the several features that can be used to improve peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR), ranging from the simple use of hollow NGCs to tissue engineered intraluminal fillers, or to even more advanced strategies, comprising the molecular and gene therapies as well as cell-based therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Cristiana R Carvalho, Joaquim M Oliveira, Rui L Reis<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Bioeng Biotechnol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2296-4185<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.248<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31824934">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Extracellular Vesicles in Modifying the Effects of Ionizing Radiation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-coated nanovesicles actively secreted by almost all cell types. EVs can travel long distances within the body, being finally taken up by the target cells, transferring information from one cell to another, thus influencing their behavior. The cargo of EVs comprises of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins derived from the cell of origin, thereby it is cell-type specific; moreover, it differs between diseased and normal cells. Several studies have shown that EVs have a role in tumor formation and prognosis. It was also demonstrated that ionizing radiation can alter the cargo of EVs. EVs, in turn can modulate radiation responses and they play a role in radiation-induced bystander effects. Due to their biocompatibility and selective targeting, EVs are suitable nanocarrier candidates of drugs in various diseases, including cancer. Furthermore, the cargo of EVs can be engineered, and in this way they can be designed to carry certain genes or even drugs, similar to synthetic nanoparticles. In this review, we describe the biological characteristics of EVs, focusing on the recent efforts to use EVs as nanocarriers in oncology, the effects of EVs in radiation therapy, highlighting the possibilities to use EVs as nanocarriers to modulate radiation effects in clinical applications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Tünde Szatmári, Rita Hargitai, Géza Sáfrány, Katalin Lumniczky<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698689">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Development of Functional Non-Viral Vectors for Gene Delivery.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene therapy is manipulation in/of gene expression in specific cells/tissue to treat diseases. This manipulation is carried out by introducing exogenous nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, into the cell. Because of their negative charge and considerable larger size, the delivery of these molecules, in general, should be mediated by gene vectors. Non-viral vectors, as promising delivery systems, have received considerable attention due to their low cytotoxicity and non-immunogenicity. As research continued, more and more functional non-viral vectors have emerged. They not only have the ability to deliver a gene into the cells but also have other functions, such as the performance of fluorescence imaging, which aids in monitoring their progress, targeted delivery, and biodegradation. Recently, many reviews related to non-viral vectors, such as polymers and cationic lipids, have been reported. However, there are few reviews regarding functional non-viral vectors. This review summarizes the common functional non-viral vectors developed in the last ten years and their potential applications in the future. The transfection efficiency and the transport mechanism of these materials were also discussed in detail.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are hallmarks of HD neurons. The extraneural manifestations of HD are still unclear. We investigated the crosstalk between mitochondria and proteolytic function in skin fibroblasts from juvenile HD patients. We found reduced mitosis, increased cell size, elevated ROS and increased mitochondrial membrane potential in juvenile HD fibroblasts, while cellular viability was maintained. Mitochondrial OXPHOS analysis did not reveal significant differences compared to control. However, the level of mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins was significantly lower and branching in the mitochondria network was reduced. We hypothesized that juvenile HD fibroblasts counterbalance cellular damage and mitochondrial network deficit with altered proteasome activity to promote cell survival. Our data reveal that juvenile HD fibroblasts exhibit higher proteasome activity, which was associated with elevated gene and protein expression of parkin. Moreover, we demonstrate elevated proteasomal degradation of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn1 in diseased cells compared to control cells. Our data suggest that juvenile HD fibroblasts respond to mutant polyQ expansion of Htt with enhanced proteasome activity and faster turnover of specific UPS substrates to protect cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Azzam Aladdin, Róbert Király, Pal Boto, Zsolt Regdon, Krisztina Tar<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31717806">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A few ethical issues in translational research for gene and cell therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Although translational research for drug development can provide patients with valuable therapeutic resources it is not without risk, especially in the early-phase trials that present the highest degree of uncertainty. With the extraordinary evolution of biomedical technologies, a growing number of innovative products based on human cells and gene therapy are being tested and used as drugs. Their use on humans poses several challenges.
METHODS: In this work, we discuss some ethical issues related to gene and cell therapies translational research. We focus on early-phase studies analysing the regulatory approach of Europe and the United States. We report the current recommendations and guidelines of international scientific societies and European and American regulatory authorities.
RESULTS: The peculiarity of human cell- or tissue-based products and gene therapy has required the development of specific regulatory tools that must be continually updated in line with the progress of the research. The ethics of translational research for these products also requires further considerations, particularly with respect to the specificity of the associated risk profiles.

Due to the increase in population and longevity, incidence will triple by the middle of the twenty-first century. So far, no treatment has prevented or reversed the disease. More than 20 years of multidisciplinary studies have shown that brain zinc dyshomeostasis may play a critical role in AD progression, which provides encouraging clues for metal-targeted therapies in the treatment of AD. Unfortunately, the pilot clinical application of zinc chelator and/or ionophore strategy, such as the use of quinoline-based compounds, namely clioquinol and PBT2, has not yet been successful. The emerging findings revealed a list of key zinc transporters whose mRNA or protein levels were abnormally altered at different stages of AD brains. Furthermore, specifically modulating the expression of some of the zinc transporters in the central nervous system through genetic methods slowed down or prevented AD progression in animal models, resulting in significantly improved cognitive performance, movement, and prolonged lifespan. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it shed new light on the treatment or prevention of the disease. This review considers recent advances regarding AD, zinc and zinc transporters, recapitulating their relationships in extending our current understanding of the disease amelioration effects of zinc transport proteins as potential therapeutic targets to cure AD, and it may also provide new insights to identify novel therapeutic strategies for ageing and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Yingshuo Xu, Guiran Xiao, Li Liu, Minglin Lang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Brain<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-6606<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.19<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.109<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818314">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Autophagic and endo-lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Due to their post-mitotic state, metabolic demands and often large polarised morphology, the function and survival of neurons is dependent on an efficient cellular waste clearance system both for generation of materials for metabolic processes and removal of toxic components.

We previously reported that the proliferation and functioning of the cells transfected with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene, a suicide gene, can be controlled by administration of ganciclovir. In this study, we tried to control the amount of murine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secreted from transplanted murine mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10T1/2 cells to achieve safe cell-based IFN-γ gene therapy for cancer. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with HSVtk- and murine IFN-γ-expressing plasmid vectors to obtain C3H10T1/2/HSVtk/IFN-γ cells. C3H10T1/2/HSVtk/IFN-γ cells released IFN-γ and were sensitive to ganciclovir. C3H10T1/2/HSVtk/IFN-γ cells significantly suppressed the proliferation of murine adenocarcinoma cell line colon26 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, subcutaneous administration of ganciclovir to mice transplanted with NanoLuc luciferase-expressing C3H10T1/2/HSVtk cells for three consecutive days reduced the luminescence signals from the transplanted cells. These results indicate that the cell regulation system using HSVtk gene and ganciclovir can be useful for safe and efficient cell-based IFN-γ gene therapy for cancer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Mari Tsujimura, Kosuke Kusamori, Hidemasa Katsumi, Toshiyasu Sakane, Akira Yamamoto, Makiya Nishikawa<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31827180">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pre-diagnosing and managing patients with GM1 gangliosidosis and related disorders by the evaluation of GM1 ganglioside content.<br><b>Abstract:</b> GM1 ganglioside, a monosialic glycosphingolipid and a crucial component of plasma membranes, accumulates in lysosomal storage disorders, primarily in GM1 gangliosidosis. The development of biomarkers for simplifying diagnosis, monitoring disease progression and evaluating drug therapies is an important objective in research into neurodegenerative lysosomal disorders. With this in mind, we established fluorescent imaging and flow-cytometric methods to track changes in GM1 ganglioside levels in patients with GM1 gangliosidosis and in control cells. We also evaluated GM1 ganglioside content in patients' cells treated with the commercially available Miglustat, a substrate inhibitor potentially suitable for the treatment of late-onset GM1 gangliosidosis. The flow-cytometric method proved to be sensitive, unbiased, and rapid in determining variations in GM1 ganglioside content in human lymphocytes derived from small amounts of fresh blood. We detected a strong correlation between GM1 ganglioside content and the clinical severity of GM1 gangliosidosis. We confirm the ability of Miglustat to act as a substrate reduction agent in the patients' treated cells.

Gaucher disease is one of the most common types of LSDs caused by mutations to the lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Here, we describe a genetic strategy to produce engineered exosomes loaded with GBA in two different spatial configurations for targeted delivery to the endocytic compartment of recipient cells. By fusing human GBA to an exosome-anchoring protein: vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), we demonstrate that the chimeric proteins were successfully integrated into exosomes which were secreted as extracellular vesicles (EVs) by producer cells. Isolation and molecular characterization of EVs confirmed that the fusion proteins were loaded onto exosomes without altering their surface markers, particle size or distribution. Further, enzyme-loaded exosomes/EVs added to cultured medium were taken up by recipient cells. Further, the endocytosed exosomes/EVs targeted to endocytic compartments exhibited a significant increase in GBA activity. Together, we have developed a novel method for targeting and delivery of lysosomal enzymes to their natural location: the endocytic compartment of recipient cells. Since exosomes/EVs have an intrinsic ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, our technology may provide a new approach to treat severe types of LSDs, including Gaucher disease with neurological complications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Mai Anh Do, Daniel Levy, Annie Brown, Gerard Marriott, Biao Lu<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31754156">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> mTOR and autophagy pathways are dysregulated in murine and human models of Schaaf-Yang syndrome.<br><b>Abstract:</b> MAGEL2 is a maternally imprinted, paternally expressed gene, located in the Prader-Willi region of human chromosome 15. Pathogenic variants in the paternal copy of MAGEL2 cause Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SHFYNG), a neurodevelopmental disorder related to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Patients with SHFYNG, like PWS, manifest neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulties, hypogonadism, intellectual disability and sleep apnea. However, individuals with SHFYNG have joint contractures, greater cognitive impairment, and higher prevalence of autism than seen in PWS. Additionally, SHFYNG is associated with a lower prevalence of hyperphagia and obesity than PWS. Previous studies have shown that truncating variants in MAGEL2 lead to SHFYNG. However, the molecular pathways involved in manifestation of the SHFYNG disease phenotype are still unknown. Here we show that a Magel2 null mouse model and fibroblast cell lines from individuals with SHFYNG exhibit increased expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and decreased autophagy. Additionally, we show that SHFYNG induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons exhibit impaired dendrite formation. Alterations in SHFYNG patient fibroblast lines and iPSC-derived neurons are rescued by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a significant volume loss in the visual cortex, and histological analyses confirmed the degeneration of the lateral geniculate nuclei and visual cortex in the affected marmosets. These marmosets did not have elevated intraocular pressure, but showed an increased oxidative stress level, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB expression in the retina, optic nerve head and CSF.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has roles including regulating inflammation, and promoting vasodilatation; it also exhibits anti-oxidative stress and anti-fibrosis effects. H2S has been reported to alleviate lung injury, but the effects and mechanism of H2S on VILI remain unclear. The present study established a rat model of VILI and treated them with H2S, then measured the changes in respiratory function indicators, lung tissue histopathology, and oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic indicators. The effect of H2S on autophagy in the VILI model and the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were also investigated. To further explore the mechanism, L2 alveolar epithelial cells were treated with cyclic strain to mimic mechanical strain along with the H2S donor NaHS, and the involvement of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was examined. The results showed that H2S significantly alleviated VILI and inhibited the inflammation and oxidative stress induced by VILI. H2S also significantly reduced autophagy and ER stress in rats. The phosphorylation of IRE1α, PERK and eIF2α and the expression of nuclear ATF4, and GADD34 in L2 cells were all significantly reduced with NaHS. Nuclear NF-κB p65, MAPK p38, JNK, and ERK were all activated by cyclic strain, but inhibited by the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA or NaHS. Our findings revealed that H2S treatment alleviated VILI by regulating autophagy and ER stress, and the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/GADD34 and NF-κB/MAPK pathways were involved in the underlying mechanism.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoli Ge, Jian Sun, Aihua Fei, Chengjin Gao, Shuming Pan, Zengbin Wu<br><b>Journal:</b> Int.

Microglia in particular, may contribute to the induction and modulation of inflammation in PD. Upon stimulation, microglia convert into activated phenotypes, which exist along a dynamic continuum and bear different immune properties depending on the disease stage and severity. Activated microglia release various factors involved in neuroinflammation, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and prostaglandins (PGs). Further, activated microglia interact with other cell types (e.g., neurons, astrocytes and mast cells) and are closely associated with α-synuclein (α-syn) pathophysiology and iron homeostasis disturbance. Taken together, microglial activation and microglia-mediated inflammatory responses play essential roles in the pathogenesis of PD and elucidation of the complexity and imbalance of microglial activation may shed light on novel therapeutic approaches for PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Cai-Yun Liu, Xu Wang, Chang Liu, Hong-Liang Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Cell Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1662-5102<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.91<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.036<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803024">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Quantitative whole-brain 3D imaging of tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled neuron architecture in the mouse MPTP model of Parkinson's disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is a basal ganglia movement disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Immunohistochemical methods have been widely used for characterization of dopaminergic neuronal injury in animal models of PD, including the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model. However, conventional immunohistochemical techniques applied to tissue sections have inherent limitations with respect to loss of 3D resolution, yielding insufficient information on the architecture of the dopaminergic system. To provide a more comprehensive and non-biased map of MPTP-induced changes in central dopaminergic pathways, we used iDISCO immunolabeling, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and deep-learning computational methods for whole-brain three-dimensional visualization and automated quantitation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the adult mouse brain. Mice terminated 7 days after acute MPTP administration demonstrated widespread alterations in TH expression. Compared to vehicle controls, MPTP-dosed mice showed a significant loss of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Also, MPTP dosing reduced overall TH signal intensity in basal ganglia nuclei, i.e. the substantia nigra, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus. In contrast, increased TH signal intensity was predominantly observed in limbic regions, including several subdivisions of the amygdala and hypothalamus. In conclusion, mouse whole-brain 3D imaging is ideal for unbiased automated counting and densitometric analysis of TH-positive cells. The LSFM-deep learning pipeline tracked brain-wide changes in catecholaminergic pathways in the MPTP mouse model of PD, and may be applied for preclinical characterization of compounds targeting dopaminergic neurotransmission.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Urmas Roostalu, Casper B G Salinas, Ditte D Thorbek, Jacob L Skytte, Katrine Fabricius, Pernille Barkholt, Linu M John, Vanessa Isabell Jurtz, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, Jacob Jelsing, Niels Vrang, Henrik H Hansen, Jacob Hecksher-Sørensen<br><b>Journal:</b> Dis Model Mech<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1754-8411<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.114<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31704726">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Recent Advances in the Use of Focused Ultrasound for Magnetic Resonance Image-Guided Therapeutic Nanoparticle Delivery to the Central Nervous System.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Targeting systemically-administered drugs and genes to specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS) remains a challenge. With applications extending into numerous disorders and cancers, there is an obvious need for approaches that facilitate the delivery of therapeutics across the impervious blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging treatment method that leverages acoustic energy to oscillate simultaneously administered contrast agent microbubbles. This FUS-mediated technique temporarily disrupts the BBB, allowing ordinarily impenetrable agents to diffuse and/or convect into the CNS. Under magnetic resonance image guidance, FUS and microbubbles enable regional targeting-limiting the large, and potentially toxic, dosage that is often characteristic of systemically-administered therapies. Subsequent to delivery across the BBB, therapeutics face yet another challenge: penetrating the electrostatically-charged, mesh-like brain parenchyma. Non-bioadhesive, encapsulated nanoparticles can help overcome this additional barrier to promote widespread treatment in selected target areas. Furthermore, nanoparticles offer significant advantages over conventional systemically-administered therapeutics. Surface modifications of nanoparticles can be engineered to enhance targeted cellular uptake, and nanoparticle formulations can be tailored to control many pharmacokinetic properties such as rate of drug liberation, distribution, and excretion. For instance, nanoparticles loaded with gene plasmids foster relatively stable transfection, thus obviating the need for multiple, successive treatments. As the formulations and applications of these nanoparticles can vary greatly, this review article provides an overview of FUS coupled with polymeric or lipid-based nanoparticles currently utilized for drug delivery, diagnosis, and assessment of function in the CNS.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Delaney G Fisher, Richard J Price<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Pharmacol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1663-9812<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.86<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.256<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798453">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Knock-Down of GPR88 in the Dorsal Striatum Alters the Response of Medium Spiny Neurons to the Loss of Dopamine Input and L-3-4-Dyhydroxyphenylalanine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The effects of L-3-4-dyhydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment for replacing the dopamine (DA) loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) progressively wear off and are hindered by the development of dyskinesia, prompting the search for new treatments.

To date, a large number of clinical trials involving DC-based vaccines have been conducted with a view to treating tumors of different histological origins. However, DC-based vaccines had several drawbacks, including problems with targeted delivery of tumor antigens to DCs and prolong storage of cellular vaccines. Therefore, the development of other immunotherapeutic approaches capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of existing DC-based vaccines or directly triggering anti-tumor immune responses is of great interest. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all types of eukaryotic cells for paracrine signaling. EVs can interact with target cells and change their functional activity by delivering different signaling molecules including mRNA, non-coding RNA, proteins, and lipids. EVs have potential benefits as natural vectors for the delivery of RNA and other therapeutic molecules targeted to DCs, T-lymphocytes, and tumor cells; therefore, EVs are a promising entity for the development of novel cell-free anti-tumor vaccines that may be a favourable alternative to DC-based vaccines. In the present review, we discuss the anti-tumor potential of EVs derived from DCs, tumors, and other cells.

While it is now clear that astrocytes are affected by HD and significantly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and pathogenesis, the alterations in the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles in HD astrocytes have yet to be characterized. Here, we examine global transcription and chromatin accessibility dynamics during in vitro astrocyte differentiation in a transgenic non-human primate model of HD.
RESULTS: We found global changes in accessibility and transcription across different stages of HD pluripotent stem cell differentiation, with distinct trends first observed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), once cells have committed to a neural lineage. Transcription of p53 signaling and cell cycle pathway genes was highly impacted during differentiation, with depletion in HD NPCs and upregulation in HD astrocytes. E2F target genes also displayed this inverse expression pattern, and strong associations between E2F target gene expression and accessibility at nearby putative enhancers were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that chromatin accessibility and transcription are altered throughout in vitro HD astrocyte differentiation and provide evidence that E2F dysregulation contributes to aberrant cell-cycle re-entry and apoptosis throughout the progression from NPCs to astrocytes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Alexandra V Goodnight, Isaac Kremsky, Sujittra Khampang, Yoon Hee Jung, James M Billingsley, Steven E Bosinger, Victor G Corces, Anthony W S Chan<br><b>Journal:</b> Epigenetics Chromatin<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-8935<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.84<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.064<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31722751">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Successes and Hurdles in Stem Cells Application and Production for Brain Transplantation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Brain regenerative strategies through the transplantation of stem cells hold the potential to promote functional rescue of brain lesions caused either by trauma or neurodegenerative diseases. Most of the positive modulations fostered by stem cells are fueled by bystander effects, namely increase of neurotrophic factors levels and reduction of neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of cell therapies is to promote cell replacement. Therefore, the ability of stem cells to migrate and differentiate into neurons that later become integrated into the host neuronal network replacing the lost neurons has also been largely explored. However, as most of the preclinical studies demonstrate, there is a small functional integration of graft-derived neurons into host neuronal circuits. Thus, it is mandatory to better study the whole brain cell therapy approach in order to understand what should be better comprehended concerning graft-derived neuronal and glial cells migration and integration before we can expect these therapies to be ready as a viable solution for brain disorder treatment. Therefore, this review discusses the positive mechanisms triggered by cell transplantation into the brain, the limitations of adult brain plasticity that might interfere with the neuroregeneration process, as well as some strategies tested to overcome some of these limitations. It also considers the efforts that have been made by the regulatory authorities to lead to better standardization of preclinical and clinical studies in this field in order to reduce the heterogeneity of the obtained results.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Henriques, Ricardo Moreira, Jens Schwamborn, Luís Pereira de Almeida, Liliana S Mendonça<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1662-4548<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.81<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.665<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31802998">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Microalgal Carotenoids: A Review of Production, Current Markets, Regulations, and Future Direction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Microalgae produce a variety of compounds that are beneficial to human and animal health.

The objective of this review is to evaluate the potential of using microalgae as a commercial feedstock for carotenoid production. While microalgae can produce some of the highest concentrations of carotenoids (especially astaxanthin) in living organisms, there are challenges associated with the mass production of microalgae and downstream processing of carotenoids.

Our inability to identify and track individual neurons longitudinally in subcortical brain regions that are preferentially targeted in NDDs has left gaping holes in our knowledge of NDDs.

The repressive effect of PACAP1-38 on the apoptotic machinery has been an area of active research conferring a significant neuroprotective potential onto this peptide. A remarkable number of studies suggest its importance in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in relation to retinal metabolic disorders. In our review, we provide short descriptions of various pathological conditions (diabetic retinopathy, excitotoxic retinal injury and ischemic retinal lesion) in which the remedial effect of PACAP has been well demonstrated in various animal models. Of all the pathological conditions, diabetic retinopathy seems to be the most intriguing as it develops in 75% of patients with type 1 and 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes, with concomitant progression to legal blindness in about 5%. Several animal models have been developed in recent years to study retinal degenerations and out of these glaucoma and age-related retina degeneration models bear human recapitulations. PACAP neuroprotection is thought to operate through enhanced cAMP production upon binding to PAC1-R. However, the underlying signaling network that leads to neuroprotection is not fully understood. We observed that (i) PACAP is not equally efficient in the above conditions; (ii) in some cases more than one signaling pathways are activated; (iii) the coupling of PAC1-R and signaling is stage dependent; and (iv) PAC1-R is not the only receptor that must be considered to interpret the effects in our experiments. These observations point to a complex signaling mechanism, that involves alternative routes besides the classical cAMP/protein kinase A pathway to evoke the outstanding neuroprotective action. Consequently, the possible contribution of the other two main receptors (VPAC1-R and VPAC2-R) will also be discussed. Finally, the potential medical use of PACAP in some retinal and ocular disorders will also be reviewed. By taking advantage of, low-cost synthesis technologies today, PACAP may serve as an alternative to the expensive treatment modelities currently available in ocular or retinal conditions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Robert Gábriel, Etelka Pöstyéni, Viktória Dénes<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1662-4548<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.81<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.665<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649495">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Arabidopsis thaliana alternative dehydrogenases: a potential therapy for mitochondrial complex I deficiency? Perspectives and pitfalls.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.
RESULTS: We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH-2 (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the mitochondria were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per oxygen atom reduced to water by half in control cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH-2 should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Alessia Catania, Arcangela Iuso, Juliette Bouchereau, Laura S Kremer, Marina Paviolo, Caterina Terrile, Paule Bénit, Allan G Rasmusson, Thomas Schwarzmayr, Valeria Tiranti, Pierre Rustin, Malgorzata Rak, Holger Prokisch, Manuel Schiff<br><b>Journal:</b> Orphanet J Rare Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1750-1172<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.589<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665043">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The use or generation of biomedical data and existing medicines to discover and establish new treatments for patients with rare diseases - recommendations of the IRDiRC Data Mining and Repurposing Task Force.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The number of available therapies for rare diseases remains low, as fewer than 6% of rare diseases have an approved treatment option.

In reviewing past successes of data mining for drug repurposing, and planning for future biomedical research capacity, the DMR Task Force identified four strategic infrastructure investment areas to focus on in order to accelerate rare disease research productivity and drug development: (1) improving the capture and sharing of self-reported patient data, (2) better integration of existing research data, (3) increasing experimental testing capacity, and (4) sharing of rare disease research and development expertise.

Methods: Rat's BMSCs were cultured and identified. The XIAP gene of BMSCs was modified by adenovirus expression vector Ad-XIAP-GFP. The rat model of CP with ischemia and anoxia was established by ligating the left common carotid artery and anoxia for 2 h, and BMSCs were intracerebroventricularly injected to the modeled rats. The mRNA and protein expression of XIAP in brain tissue of rats in each group was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The neurobehavioral situation, content of acetylcholine (Ach), activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE), brain pathological injury, apoptosis of brain nerve cells and the activation of astrocytes in CP rats were determined via a series of assays.
Results: Rats with CP exhibited obvious abnormalities, increased Ach content, decreased AchE activity, obvious pathological damage, increased brain nerve cell apoptosis, as well as elevated activation of astrocyte. XIAP overexpressed BMSCs improved the neurobehavioral situation, decreased Ach content and increased AchE activity, attenuated brain pathological injury, inhibited apoptosis of brain nerve cells and the activation of astrocytes in CP rats.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that XIAP overexpressed BMSCs can inhibit the apoptosis of brain nerve cells and the activation of astrocytes, increase AchE activity, and inhibit Ach content, so as to lower the CP caused by cerebral ischemia and hypoxia in rats.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Deng, Chenghe Fan, Yanbo Fang, Yanan Zhao, Yamin Wei, Meng Li, Junfang Teng<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancer Cell Int.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1475-2867<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.63<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.180<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660045">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Overexpression of miR-146a Might Regulate Polarization Transitions of BV-2 Cells Induced by High Glucose and Glucose Fluctuations.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Microglia are critical in neuroinflammation. M1/M2 polarization transitions of microglial phenotypes determine the states of neuroinflammation and are regulated by multiple pathways, including miRNAs and other epigenetic regulations. This study investigated the polarization transitions of microglia induced by high glucose and glucose fluctuations, and the role of miR-146a in regulating M1/M2 polarization transitions of microglia. BV-2 cells were cultured with 25 mmol/L glucose, 75 mmol/L glucose, and 25 mmol/L-75 mmol/L glucose fluctuation for 48 h. BV-2 cells overexpressing miR-146a were generated using a lentiviral vector. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure mRNA expression of miR-146a, CD11b, iNOS, Arg-1, IRAK1, TRAF6, and NF-κB. Immunofluorescence was used to measure CD11b expression. Western blot was used to measure protein expression of CD11b, iNOS, and Arg-1. Compared with those in the 25 mmol/L glucose control group, expression of CD11b, iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the 75 mmol/L glucose or glucose fluctuation groups of cultured BV-2 cells were significantly increased, while Arg-1 and IL-10 was significantly decreased. These effects were reversed by overexpression of miR-146a. Furthermore, expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, and NF-κB was significantly increased in the high glucose and glucose fluctuation groups; this was reduced after miR-146a overexpression. In sum, high glucose and glucose fluctuations induced polarization transitions from M1 to M2 phenotype in BV-2 cells. Overexpression of miR-146a might protect BV-2 cells from high glucose and glucose fluctuation associated with M1/M2 polarization transitions by downregulating the expression of IRAK1, TRAF6, and NF-κB.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Yinqiong Huang, Zhenling Liao, Xiahong Lin, Xiaohong Wu, Xiaoyu Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yong Zhuang, Yingxia Yang, Jinying Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-2392<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.63<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.344<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695681">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dysfunctional Mitochondria and Mitophagy as Drivers of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Neurons are highly specialized post-mitotic cells that are inherently dependent on mitochondria owing to their high bioenergetic demand. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore associated with various age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), wherein accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria has been reported as an early symptom further contributing to disease progression. In AD, impairment of mitochondrial function causes bioenergetic deficiency, intracellular calcium imbalance and oxidative stress, thereby aggravating the effect of Aβ and tau pathologies, leading to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and memory loss. Although there are reports suggesting intricate parallelism between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathologies such as Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation, the factors that drive the pathogenesis of either are unclear. In addition, emerging evidence suggest that mitochondrial quality control (QC) mechanisms such as mitophagy are impaired in AD. As an important mitochondrial QC mechanism, mitophagy plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health and function. Studies show that various proteins involved in mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis are affected in AD. Compromised mitophagy may also be attributed to impairment in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and defects in lysosomal acidification. Therapeutic interventions aiming to restore mitophagy functions can be used as a strategy for ameliorating AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence implicates the role of microglial activation via mitophagy induction in reducing amyloid plaque load.

The onset of AD is insidious, gradually progressive and multifactorial. The recent accumulated scientific evidences suggests that the pathological changes resemble the autoimmune-driven self-sustaining inflammatory process as a result of prolonged oxidative stress and immune dyshomeostasis. Apart from aging, during life span various other factors-mainly environmental, lifestyle, chronic stress, polymicrobial infections and neuroendocrine functions-affect the immune system. Here, we provide crosstalk among "trigger insults/inflammatory stimulus" i.e., polymicrobial infection, chronic stress, pro-inflammatory diet and cholinergic signaling to put forward a "Systemic Immune Dyshomeostasis" model as to connect the events leading to AD development and progression. Our model implicates altered cholinergic signaling and suggests pathological stages with various modifiable risk factors and triggers at different chronological age and stage of cognitive decline. The search of specific autoantibodies for AD which may serve as the suitable blood/CSF biomarkers should be actively pursued for the early diagnosis of AD. The preventive and therapeutic strategies should be directed towards maintaining the normal functioning of the immune system throughout the life span and specific modulation of the immune responses in the brain depending on the stage of changes in brain.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Puneet Talwar, Suman Kushwaha, Renu Gupta, Rachna Agarwal<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Aging Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1663-4365<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.61<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.474<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31736740">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nanomaterials for Healthcare Biosensing Applications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, an increasing number of nanomaterials have been explored for their applications in biomedical diagnostics, making their applications in healthcare biosensing a rapidly evolving field.

Particularly vitamin B1 (thiamine), B6 (pyridoxine), and B12 (cobalamin) contribute essentially to the maintenance of a healthy nervous system. Their importance is highlighted by many neurological diseases related to deficiencies in one or more of these vitamins, but they can improve certain neurological conditions even without a (proven) deficiency.
AIM: This review focuses on the most important biochemical mechanisms, how they are linked with neurological functions and what deficits arise from malfunctioning of these pathways.
DISCUSSION: We discussed the main role of B Vitamins on several functions in the peripheral and central nervous system (PNS and CNS) including cellular energetic processes, antioxidative and neuroprotective effects, and both myelin and neurotransmitter synthesis. We also provide an overview of possible biochemical synergies between thiamine, pyridoxine, and cobalamin and discuss by which major roles each of them may contribute to the synergy and how these functions are inter-related and complement each other.
CONCLUSION: Taking into account the current knowledge on the neurotropic vitamins B1, B6, and B12, we conclude that a biochemical synergy becomes apparent in many different pathways in the nervous system, particularly in the PNS as exemplified by their combined use in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Alberto Calderón-Ospina, Mauricio Orlando Nava-Mesa<br><b>Journal:</b> CNS Neurosci Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1755-5949<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.46<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.122<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490017">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Off-Target Effects in Transgenic Mice: Characterization of Dopamine Transporter (DAT)-Cre Transgenic Mouse Lines Exposes Multiple Non-Dopaminergic Neuronal Clusters Available for Selective Targeting within Limbic Neurocircuitry.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Transgenic mouse lines are instrumental in our attempt to understand brain function.

These molecules play critical roles from embryogenesis to adult stages; therefore, alterations such as abnormal expression or mutations of the genes involved and their downstream factors cause a variety of genetic disorders at different stages. The Hh family involves many signaling mediators and functions through complex mechanisms, and achieving a comprehensive understanding of the entire signaling system is challenging. This review discusses the signaling mediators of the Hh pathway and their functions at the cellular and organismal levels. We first focus on the roles of Hh signaling mediators in signal transduction at the cellular level and the networks formed by these factors. Then, we analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of expression of Hh pathway molecules in tissues and organs, and describe the phenotypes of mutant mice.

It impacts quality of life and creates safety concerns in the home, at work, and on the roads. Screening questionnaires can be used to estimate EDS, but further evaluation is necessary. EDS is a common symptom of both narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing are used to diagnose these disorders. However, isolating the primary etiology of EDS can be challenging and may be multifactorial. Untreated OSA can show polysomnographic findings that are similar to narcolepsy. The effects of sleep deprivation and certain medications can also affect the polysomnographic results. These challenges can lead to misdiagnosis. In addition, narcolepsy and OSA can occur as comorbid disorders. If EDS persists despite adequate treatment for either disorder, a comorbid diagnosis should be sought. Thus, despite advances in clinical practice, appropriate management of these patients can be challenging.

To guide their application across disease models, and to inspire the development of translational gene therapy vectors for targeting neurological diseases in humans, we sought to elucidate the host factors responsible for the CNS tropism of the AAV-PHP.B vectors. Leveraging CNS tropism differences across 13 mouse strains, we systematically determined a set of genetic variants that segregate with the permissivity phenotype, and rapidly identified LY6A as an essential receptor for the AAV-PHP.B vectors. Interfering with LY6A by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Ly6a disruption or with blocking antibodies reduced transduction of mouse brain endothelial cells by AAV-PHP.eB, while ectopic expression of Ly6a increased AAV-PHP.eB transduction of HEK293T and CHO cells by 30-fold or more. Importantly, we demonstrate that this newly discovered mode of AAV binding and transduction can occur independently of other known AAV receptors.

To limit therapeutic misconception, information should be provided on the rationale for clinical trials and the differences between clinical research and clinical care should be carefully discussed.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Susanne Tamara de Bot<br><b>Journal:</b> J Huntingtons Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1879-6400<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.61<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.124<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640105">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Molecular and Cellular Response of Co-cultured Cells toward Cobalt Chloride (CoCl<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cobalt chloride (CoCl<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Vinay Kumar Tripathi, Sivakumar Allur Subramaniyan, Inho Hwang<br><b>Journal:</b> ACS Omega<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2470-1343<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.55<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.754<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867478">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cytochalasin-B-Inducible Nanovesicle Mimics of Natural Extracellular Vesicles That Are Capable of Nucleic Acid Transfer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Extracellular vesicles provide cell-to-cell communication and have great potential for use as therapeutic carriers.

Three types of nanovesicles were assayed as oligonucleotide carriers: mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles and mimics prepared either by cell treatment with cytochalasin B or by vesicle generation from plasma membrane. Nanovesicles were loaded with a DNA oligonucleotide by freezing/thawing, sonication, or permeabilization with saponin. Oligonucleotide delivery was assayed using HEK293 cells. Extracellular vesicles and mimics were characterized by a similar oligonucleotide loading level but different efficiency of oligonucleotide delivery. Cytochalasin-B-inducible nanovesicles exhibited the highest level of oligonucleotide accumulation in HEK293 cells and a loading capacity of 0.44 ± 0.05 pmol/µg.

The ability to modify selectively specific genes provides a powerful tool for characterizing gene functions, performing gene therapy, correcting specific genetic mutations, eradicating diseases, engineering cells and organisms to achieve new and different functions and obtaining transgenic animals as models for studying specific diseases. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology has recently revolutionized genome engineering. The application of this new technology to stem cell research allows disease models to be developed to explore new therapeutic tools. The possibility of translating new systems of molecular knowledge to clinical research is particularly appealing for addressing degenerative diseases. In this review, we describe several applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to stem cells related to degenerative diseases.

While the beneficial effects of such cell-based therapy have already been documented in terms of neurodegeneration of various origins, a neurophysiological basis for improvement in the recovery of neurological function is still not completely understood. This overview briefly describes the cumulative evidence from electrophysiological studies of NSC-derived neurons, aimed at establishing the maturation of differentiated neurons within a host microenvironment, and their integration into the host circuits, with a particular focus on the neurogenesis of NSC grafts within the post-ischemic milieu. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that the host microenvironment largely regulates the lineage of NSC grafts. This regulatory role, as yet underestimated, raises possibilities for the favoured maturation of a subset of neural phenotypes in order to gain timely remodelling of the impaired brain tissue and amplify the therapeutic effects of NSC-based therapy for recovery of neurological function.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Olga Kopach<br><b>Journal:</b> World J Stem Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1948-0210<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.45<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.543<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768224">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Neural stem cell transplantation therapy for brain ischemic stroke: Review and perspectives.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Brain ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of death and disability, currently has no efficient therapeutic strategy in clinic. Due to irreversible functional neurons loss and neural tissue injury, stem cell transplantation may be the most promising treatment approach. Neural stem cells (NSCs) as the special type of stem cells only exist in the nervous system, can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, and have the abilities to compensate insufficient endogenous nerve cells and improve the inflammatory microenvironment of cell survival. In this review, we focused on the important role of NSCs therapy for brain ischemic stroke, mainly introduced the methods of optimizing the therapeutic efficacy of NSC transplantation, such as transfection and overexpression of specific genes, pretreatment of NSCs with inflammatory factors, and co-transplantation with cytokines. Next, we discussed the potential problems of NSC transplantation which seriously limited their rapid clinical transformation and application. Finally, we expected a new research topic in the field of stem cell research. Based on the bystander effect, exosomes derived from NSCs can overcome many of the risks and difficulties associated with cell therapy. Thus, as natural seed resource of nervous system, NSCs-based cell-free treatment is a newly therapy strategy, will play more important role in treating ischemic stroke in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Gui-Long Zhang, Zhi-Han Zhu, Ye-Zhong Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> World J Stem Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1948-0210<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.45<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.543<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692854">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Aging: A cell source limiting factor in tissue engineering.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Tissue engineering has yet to reach its ideal goal, <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadhossein Khorraminejad-Shirazi, Mohammadreza Dorvash, Alireza Estedlal, Amir Human Hoveidaei, Mohsen Mazloomrezaei, Pouria Mosaddeghi<br><b>Journal:</b> World J Stem Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1948-0210<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.45<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.543<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692986">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genomic integrity of human induced pluripotent stem cells: Reprogramming, differentiation and applications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Ten years after the initial generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from human tissues, their potential is no longer questioned, with over 15000 publications listed on PubMed, covering various fields of research; including disease modeling, cell therapy strategies, pharmacology/toxicology screening and 3D organoid systems. However, despite evidences that the presence of mutations in hiPSCs should be a concern, publications addressing genomic integrity of these cells represent less than 1% of the literature.

A recent example of the utility of this animal model is the promising myotubularin gene delivery in boys affected by X-linked centronuclear myopathy after successful systemic, long-term efficient gene therapy in Labrador retrievers. Mostly, this is due to unique features that make dogs an optimal system. The continuous emergence of spontaneous inherited disorders enables the identification of reliable complementary molecular models for human neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). Dogs' characteristics including size, lifespan and unprecedented medical care level allow a comprehensive longitudinal description of diseases. Moreover, the highly similar pathogenic mechanisms with human patients yield to translational robustness. Finally, interindividual phenotypic heterogeneity between dogs helps identifying modifiers and anticipates precision medicine issues.This review article summarizes the present list of molecularly characterized dog models for NMDs and provides an exhaustive list of the clinical and paraclinical assays that have been developed. This toolbox offers scientists a sensitive and reliable system to thoroughly evaluate neuromuscular function, as well as efficiency and safety of innovative therapies targeting these NMDs. This review also contextualizes the model by highlighting its unique genetic value, shaped by the long-term coevolution of humans and domesticated dogs. Because the dog is one of the most protected research animal models, there is considerable opposition to include it in preclinical projects, posing a threat to the use of this model. We thus discuss ethical issues, emphasizing that unlike many other models, the dog also benefits from its contribution to comparative biomedical research with a drastic reduction in the prevalence of morbid alleles in the breeding stock and an improvement in medical care.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Inès Barthélémy, Christophe Hitte, Laurent Tiret<br><b>Journal:</b> J Neuromuscul Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2214-3602<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.44<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450509">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Simvastatin as a neuroprotective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD STAT): protocol for a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled futility study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition affecting approximately 185,000 people in the UK. No drug has been proven to slow disease progression. Epidemiological and pre-clinical data support simvastatin, a widely used cholesterol-lowering drug with a well-established safety profile, having neuroprotective properties. The aim of this study (Simvastatin as a neuroprotective treatment for PD (PD STAT)) is to determine whether simvastatin has the potential to slow PD progression. The study is part of the International Linked Clinical Trials initiative coordinated by The Cure Parkinson's Trust. This paper describes the protocol for the PD STAT study.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PD STAT is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel group, futility trial in patients with PD of mild-moderate severity. 235 participants have been recruited and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral simvastatin or matched placebo. Treatment involves a 1-month low-dose phase (40 mg daily), followed by a 23-month high-dose phase (80 mg daily) and ends with a 2-month washout period. Participants are reviewed at clinic visits at 1 month, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 26 months post-baseline, with interim telephone follow-up to monitor for adverse events.The primary outcome is the change in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor subscale score in the practically defined OFF medication state (OFF state) between baseline and 24 months. Primary analysis will be on a modified intention to treat basis and will include only those participants who progress to the high-dose phase of the study.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the North East-Newcastle and North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Committee. The results will be disseminated via research articles in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local, national and international scientific meetings, as well as disseminated via patient groups, websites and networks. A summary of the study findings will be posted to participants at the end of the study.

Current management of optic neuropathies and glaucoma focuses on intraocular pressure-lowering treatment which is insufficient. As such, patients are effectively condemned to irreversible visual impairment. This review summarizes experimental treatments targeting RGCs over the last decade. In particular, we examine the various treatment modalities and determine their viability and limitations in translation to clinical practice. Experimental RGC treatment can be divided into (1) cell replacement therapy, (2) neuroprotection, and (3) gene therapy. For cell replacement therapy, difficulties remain in successfully integrating transplanted RGCs from various sources into the complex neural network of the human retina. However, there is significant potential for achieving full visual restoration with this technique. Neuroprotective strategies, in the form of pharmacological agents, nutritional supplementation, and neurotrophic factors, are viable strategies with encouraging results from preliminary noncomparative interventional case series. It is important to note, however, that most published studies are focused on glaucoma, with few treating optic neuropathies of other etiologies. Gene therapy, through the use of viral vectors, has shown promising results in clinical trials, particularly for diseases with specific genetic mutations like Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. This treatment technique can be further extended to nonhereditary diseases, through transfer of genes promoting cell survival and neuroprotection. Crucially though, for gene therapy, teratogenicity remains a significant issue in translation to clinical practice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Lin Fu, Sum Sum Kwok, Yau Kei Chan, Jimmy Shiu Ming Lai, Weihua Pan, Li Nie, Kendrick Co Shih<br><b>Journal:</b> Biomed Res Int<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2314-6141<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.14<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.795<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828134">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gene surgery: Potential applications for human diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene therapy became in last decade a new emerging therapeutic era showing promising results against different diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurological disorders. Recently, the genome editing technique for eukaryotic cells called CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) has enriched the field of gene surgery with enhanced applications. In the present review, we summarized the different applications of gene surgery for treating human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, nervous, and cardiovascular diseases, besides the molecular mechanisms involved in these important effects. Several studies support the important therapeutic applications of gene surgery in a large number of health disorders and diseases including β-thalassemia, cancer, immunodeficiencies, diabetes, and neurological disorders. In diabetes, gene surgery was shown to be effective in type 1 diabetes by triggering different signaling pathways. Furthermore, gene surgery, especially that using CRISPR-Cas possessed important application on diagnosis, screening and treatment of several cancers such as lung, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancer.

Methods: A PubMed/MEDLINE-based systematic review has been performed combining the main Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) regarding the cell- and tissue-based therapies with the "Brain", "Spinal Cord", "Spine" and "Skull" MeSH terms. Only articles in English published in the last 10 years and pertinent to neurosurgery have been selected.
Results: A total of 1,173 relevant articles have been chosen. Somatic cells and gene-modification technologies have undergone the greatest development. Immunotherapies and gene therapies have been tested for the cure of glioblastoma, stem cells mainly for brain and spinal cord traumatic injuries. Stem cells have also found a rationale in the treatment of the cranial and spinal bony defects, and of the intervertebral disc degeneration, as well.Most of the completed or ongoing trials concerning the cell-based therapies in neurosurgery are on phase 2. Future perspectives involve the need to overcome issues related to immunogenicity, oncogenicity and routes for administration. Refinement and improvement of vector design and delivery are required within the gene therapies.
Conclusion: The last decade has been characterised by a progressive evolution of neurosurgery from a purely mechanical phase to a new biological one.

While oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilation, and pressure-reducing medications help alleviate these symptoms, they do not treat the underlying disease. Mechanical activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channels contributes to the development of pulmonary vascular disease, and overexpression of the high homology (HH) domain of the TRPV4-associated transmembrane protein CD98 has been shown to inhibit this pathway. Here, we describe the development of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the CD98 HH domain in which the AAV serotypes and promoters have been optimized for efficient and specific delivery to pulmonary cells. AAV-mediated gene delivery of the CD98 HH domain inhibited TRPV4 mechanotransduction in a specific manner and protected against pulmonary vascular leakage in a human lung Alveolus-on-a-Chip model. As AAV has been used clinically to deliver other gene therapies, these data raise the possibility of using this type of targeted approach to develop mechanotherapeutics that target the TRPV4 pathway for treatment of pulmonary edema in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Juan Li, Amy M Wen, Ratnakar Potla, Ezekiel Benshirim, Ariel Seebarran, Maximilian A Benz, Olivier Y F Henry, Benjamin D Matthews, Rachelle Prantil-Baun, Sarah E Gilpin, Oren Levy, Donald E Ingber<br><b>Journal:</b> APL Bioeng<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-2877<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803860">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Take the shortcut - direct conversion of somatic cells into induced neural stem cells and their biomedical applications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Second-generation reprogramming of somatic cells directly into the cell type of interest avoids induction of pluripotency and subsequent cumbersome differentiation procedures. Several recent studies have reported direct conversion of human somatic cells into stably proliferating induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). Importantly, iNSCs are easier, faster, and more cost-efficient to generate than induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also have a higher level of clinical safety. Stably, self-renewing iNSCs can be derived from different cellular sources, such as skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and readily differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages that are indistinguishable from their iPSC-derived counterparts or from NSCs isolated from primary tissues. This review focuses on the derivation and characterization of iNSCs and their biomedical applications. We first outline different approaches to generate iNSCs and then discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, we summarize the preclinical validation of iNSCs to highlight that these cells are promising targets for disease modeling, autologous cell therapy, and precision medicine.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Anita Erharter, Sandra Rizzi, Jerome Mertens, Frank Edenhofer<br><b>Journal:</b> FEBS Lett.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1873-3468<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663609">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves Amyloid-β Pathology by Modifying Microglial Function and Suppressing Oxidative Stress.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are increasingly being studied as a source of cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, and several groups have reported their beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study using AD model mice (APdE9), we found that transplantation of MSC via the tail vein improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze test. Using electron paramagnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the in vivo redox state of the brain, we found that MSC transplantation suppressed oxidative stress in AD model mice. To elucidate how MSC treatment ameliorates oxidative stress, we focused on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and microglial function. MSC transplantation reduced Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. Transplantation of MSC also decreased Iba1-positive area in the cortex and reduced activated ameboid shaped microglia. On the other hand, MSC transplantation accelerated accumulation of microglia around Aβ deposits and prompted microglial Aβ uptake and clearance as shown by higher frequency of Aβ-containing microglia. MSC transplantation also increased CD14-positive microglia in vivo, which play a critical role in Aβ uptake. To confirm the effects of MSC on microglia, we co-cultured the mouse microglial cell line MG6 with MSC. Co-culture with MSC enhanced Aβ uptake by MG6 cells accompanied by upregulation of CD14 expression. Additionally, co-culture of MG6 cells with MSC induced microglial phenotype switching from M1 to M2 and suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that MSC treatment has the potential to ameliorate oxidative stress through modification of microglial functions, thereby improving Aβ pathology in AD model mice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Yokokawa, Naotoshi Iwahara, Shin Hisahara, Miho C Emoto, Taro Saito, Hiromi Suzuki, Tatsuo Manabe, Akihiro Matsumura, Takashi Matsushita, Syuuichirou Suzuki, Jun Kawamata, Hideo Sato-Akaba, Hirotada G Fujii, Shun Shimohama<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

Despite recent studies suggesting that diminished protein synthesis rates may contribute to neurologic disorders, a direct link between protein synthesis rates and the progression of neurodegeneration has not been established. Moreover, it remains unclear whether reduced protein synthesis could be involved in retinal pathogenesis. Dysregulation of AKT/mTOR signaling has been reported in the retina during retinal degeneration, but to what extent this signaling contributes to translational attenuation in these mice remains uncertain.
Methods: C57BL/6J and rd16 mice were subcutaneously injected with anisomycin to chronically inhibit protein synthesis rates. An AAV2 construct encoding constitutively active 4ebp1 was subretinally delivered in wildtype animals to lower protein synthesis rates. 4ebp1/2 were knocked out in rd16 mice.
Results: Anisomycin treatment lowered retinal translation rates, accelerated retinal degeneration in rd16 mice, and initiated cell death in the retinas of C57BL/6J mice. AAV-mediated transfer of constitutively active 4ebp1-4A into the subretinal space of wildtype animals inhibited protein synthesis, and led to reduced electroretinography amplitudes and fewer ONL nuclei. Finally, we report that restoring protein synthesis rates by knocking out 4ebp1/2 was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in rhodopsin levels and a delay in retinal degeneration in rd16 mice.
Conclusions: Our study indicates that protein synthesis inhibition is likely not a cell defense mechanism in the retina by which deteriorating photoreceptors survive, but may be harmful to degenerating retinas, and that restoring protein synthesis may have therapeutic potential in delaying the progression of retinal degeneration.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Christopher R Starr, Cyril N A Nyankerh, Xiaoping Qi, Yang Hu, Oleg S Gorbatyuk, Nahum Sonenberg, Michael E Boulton, Marina S Gorbatyuk<br><b>Journal:</b> Invest.

With the discovery of bacteriorhodopsin, a light-sensitive bacterial protein, in 1971 Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius laid the pavement of optogenetics. However, the cross-integration of different disciplines is a little more than a decade old. The toolbox contains fluorescent sensors and optogenetic actuators that enable visualization of signaling events and manipulation of cellular activities, respectively. Neuropathic pain is pain caused either by damage or disease that affects the somatosensory system. The exact mechanism for neuropathic pain is not known, however proposed mechanisms include immune reactions, ion channel expressions, and inflammation. Current regimen for the disease provides about 50% relief for only 40-60% of patients. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic applications of optogenetics by manipulating the activity of neurons. This review summarizes the basic concept, therapeutic applications for neuropathy, and potential of optogenetics to reach from bench to bedside in the near future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Kang Liu, Long Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> Bosn J Basic Med Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1840-4812<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995901">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Regulation of Nrf2 Signaling.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Regulation of antioxidant gene expression is essential for controlling oxidative stress and maintaining physiological homeostasis. In this context, the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been identified as the chief regulator of the transcription of diverse antioxidant genes as well as many other cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 activity is subjected to the regulation at various levels including protein stability, transcription, and post-transcription. Among the various regulatory pathways, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 axis is the most prominent regulator of Nrf2 activity. Being a tightly controlled transcriptional activator of antioxidant genes, Nrf2 signaling is intimately involved in health and disease. While Nrf2 is a protector against oxidative and electrophilic tissue injury, persistent activation of Nrf2 signaling may also contribute to disease pathophysiology, such as cancer progression.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Robert Li, Zhenquan Jia, Hong Zhu<br><b>Journal:</b> React Oxyg Species (Apex)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2380-2367<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692987">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> From OPC to Oligodendrocyte: An Epigenetic Journey.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Oligodendrocytes provide metabolic and functional support to neuronal cells, rendering them key players in the functioning of the central nervous system. Oligodendrocytes need to be newly formed from a pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The differentiation of OPCs into mature and myelinating cells is a multistep process, tightly controlled by spatiotemporal activation and repression of specific growth and transcription factors. While oligodendrocyte turnover is rather slow under physiological conditions, a disruption in this balanced differentiation process, for example in case of a differentiation block, could have devastating consequences during ageing and in pathological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis. Over the recent years, increasing evidence has shown that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, are major contributors to OPC differentiation. In this review, we discuss how these epigenetic mechanisms orchestrate and influence oligodendrocyte maturation. These insights are a crucial starting point for studies that aim to identify the contribution of epigenetics in demyelinating diseases and may thus provide new therapeutic targets to induce myelin repair in the long run.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Assia Tiane, Melissa Schepers, Ben Rombaut, Raymond Hupperts, Jos Prickaerts, Niels Hellings, Daniel van den Hove, Tim Vanmierlo<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614602">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Compositions for oral drug administration<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present invention provides compositions and methods and for increasing the bioavailability of therapeutic agents in a subject.
