Although kidney transplantations have been performed in a small number of patients, short- and long-term follow-up data are lacking.
Methods: We describe five patients with the m.3243A<G mutation who received a kidney transplant, including follow-up data up to 13 years. We also summarize all cases (
Results: Proteinuria with or without renal failure was the first clinical presentation of renal involvement in 13 of 18 (72%) patients. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was found in 9 of 13 (69%) biopsies. Sixteen of 18 (84%) patients developed hearing loss. All patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, of whom eight (44%) developed the disease after transplantation. All patients with reported follow-up data (13/18) had stable kidney function from 6 months to 13 years of follow-up after transplantation.
Conclusions: Renal involvement in carriers of the m.3243A>G mutation most commonly leads to proteinuria and FSGS and may lead to ESRD. Proper recognition of the mitochondrial origin of the renal disease in these patients is important for adequate treatment selection and suitable supportive care. This case series and review of the available literature on long-term follow-up after kidney transplantation shows it is feasible for non-mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes phenotype carriers of the m.3243A>G mutation to be considered for kidney transplantation in case of ESRD. These patients should not be excluded from transplant solely for their mitochondrial diagnosis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31807297">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A radiologic review of hoarse voice from anatomic and neurologic perspectives.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The differential diagnosis for hoarseness is extensive and includes a multitude of etiologies that span a large geographic area from the brainstem to the mediastinum. Therefore, localizing a causative lesion can be extremely difficult for clinicians and radiologists alike. In this review, we will first discuss the normal anatomy of the larynx and its innervation via the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves. We will then proceed with a guided tour of the various infectious/inflammatory, neoplastic, congenital, and traumatic/iatrogenic causes of hoarseness subdivided by anatomic location (brainstem, skull base, carotid sheath, thyroid, larynx, and superior mediastinum). Along the way, we will discuss the various cross-sectional imaging modalities best suited to detect the often subtle signs of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. With thorough knowledge of these entities, radiologists can impact patient care by suggesting the appropriate imaging test and tailoring their search patterns to detect the subtle findings of laryngeal dysfunction.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-19<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31741090">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Longitudinal assessment of utilities in patients with migraine: an analysis of erenumab randomized controlled trials.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses in patients with migraine require estimates of patients' utility values and how these relate to monthly migraine days (MMDs). This analysis examined four different modelling approaches to assess utility values as a function of MMDs.
METHODS: Disease-specific patient-reported outcomes from three erenumab clinical studies (two in episodic migraine [NCT02456740 and NCT02483585] and one in chronic migraine [NCT02066415]) were mapped to the 5-dimension EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) as a function of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6™) using published algorithms. The mapped utility values were used to estimate generic, preference-based utility values suitable for use in economic models. Four models were assessed to explain utility values as a function of MMDs: a linear mixed effects model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML), a fractional response model with logit link, a fractional response model with probit link and a beta regression model.
RESULTS: All models tested showed very similar fittings. Root mean squared errors were similar in the four models assessed (0.115, 0.114, 0.114 and 0.114, for the linear mixed effect model with REML, fractional response model with logit link, fractional response model with probit link and beta regression model respectively), when mapped from MSQ. Mean absolute errors for the four models tested were also similar when mapped from MSQ (0.085, 0.086, 0.085 and 0.085) and HIT-6 and (0.087, 0.088, 0.088 and 0.089) for the linear mixed effect model with REML, fractional response model with logit link, fractional response model with probit link and beta regression model, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis describes the assessment of longitudinal approaches in modelling utility values and the four models proposed fitted the observed data well. Mapped utility values for patients treated with erenumab were generally higher than those for individuals treated with placebo with equivalent number of MMDs. Linking patient utility values to MMDs allows utility estimates for different levels of MMD to be predicted, for use in economic evaluations of preventive therapies.

Here we show that utilization of certain combinations of prescription medications and supplements correlates with reduced rates of cognitive decline. More than 1,900 FDA-approved agents and supplements were collapsed into 53 mechanism-based groups and traced in electronic medical records (EMRs) for >50,000 patients. These mechanistic groups were aligned with the data presented in more than 300 clinical trials, then regression model was built to fit the signals from EMRs to clinical trial performance. While EMR signals of each single agents correlated with clinical performance relatively weakly, the signals produced by combinations of active compounds were highly correlated with the clinical trial performance (R = 0.93, p = 3.8 x10^-8). Higher ranking pharmacological modalities were traced in patient profiles as their combinations, producing protective complexity estimates reflecting degrees of exposure to beneficial polypharmacy. For each age strata, the higher was the protective complexity score, the lower was the prevalence of dementia, with maximized life-long effects for the highest regression score /diversity compositions. The connection was less strong in individuals already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Confounder analysis confirmed an independent effect of protective complexity in multivariate context. A sub-cohort with lifelong odds of dementia decreased > 5-folds was identified; this sub-cohort should be studied in further details, including controlled clinical trials. In short, our study systematically explored combinatorial preventive treatment regimens for age-associated multi-morbidity, with an emphasis on neurodegeneration, and provided extensive evidence for their feasibility.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693707">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Sumatriptan Induced Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy; the Headache of the Heart: A Case Report.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) is an increasing recognized form of acute reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction not related to obstructive coronary disease. The exact physiology of this disorder is not yet known, however multiple agents have been hypothesized to have a link to this condition. Most commonly, TCM has been hypothesized as being triggered by a catecholamine surge after an inciting event. New evidence now suggests certain medications as a link to the disease.

The main active constituent of licorice is the prodrug glycyrrhizin, which is successively converted to 3β-monoglucuronyl-18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (3MGA) and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) in the intestines. Despite many reported health benefits, 3MGA and GA inhibit the 11-β-hydrogenase type II enzyme (11β-HSD2) oxidizing cortisol to cortisone. Through activation of mineralocorticoid receptors, high cortisol levels induce a mild form of apparent mineralocorticoid excess in the kidney and increase systemic vascular resistance. Continuous inhibition of 11β-HSD2 related to excess licorice consumption will create a state of hypernatremia, hypokalemia and increased fluid volume, which can cause serious life-threatening complications especially in patients already suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Two recent meta-analyses of 18 and 26 studies investigating the correlation between licorice intake and blood pressure revealed statistically significant increases both in systolic (5.45 mmHg) and in diastolic blood pressure (3.19/1.74 mmHg). This review summarizes and evaluates current literature about the acute and chronic effects of licorice ingestion on the cardiovascular system with special focus on blood pressure. Starting from the molecular actions of licorice (metabolites) inside the cells, it describes how licorice intake is affecting the human body and shows the boundaries between the health benefits of licorice and possible harmful effects.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-16<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615045">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> "Photobiomics": Can Light, Including Photobiomodulation, Alter the Microbiome?<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596658">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Leptin and Associated Mediators of Immunometabolic Signaling: Novel Molecular Outcome Measures for Neurostimulation to Treat Chronic Pain.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Chronic pain is a devastating condition affecting the physical, psychological, and socioeconomic status of the patient. Inflammation and immunometabolism play roles in the pathophysiology of chronic pain disorders. Electrical neuromodulation approaches have shown a meaningful success in otherwise drug-resistant chronic pain conditions, including failed back surgery, neuropathic pain, and migraine. A literature review (PubMed, MEDLINE/OVID, SCOPUS, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles) was performed using the following search terms: chronic pain disorders, systemic inflammation, immunometabolism, prediction, biomarkers, metabolic disorders, and neuromodulation for chronic pain. Experimental studies indicate a relationship between the development and maintenance of chronic pain conditions and a deteriorated immunometabolic state mediated by circulating cytokines, chemokines, and cellular components. A few uncontrolled in-human studies found increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines known to drive metabolic disorders in chronic pain patients undergoing neurostimulation therapies. In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge and possible relationships of available neurostimulation therapies for chronic pain with mediators of central and peripheral neuroinflammation and immunometabolism on a molecular level. However, to address the needs for predictive factors and biomarkers, large-scale databank driven clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical value of molecular profiling.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554241">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Endothelial function following interval exercise plus low-calorie diet treatment in obese females.<br><b>Abstract:</b> We determined if interval exercise plus a low-calorie diet (LCD + INT) increases endothelial function more than an energy-matched LCD.

Among 122 eligible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, 65 met the inclusion criteria. Combined EN and PN was administered for 21 days, wherein over the first 3-5 days of treatment, trophic enteral nutrition (300 kcal/day) was used with an energy increase of up to 1500 kcal. An EN was administered using a nasogastric tube or, in case of intolerance, using a naso-jejunal tube. For PN, the "All in One" system was used according to individually prepared admixtures (ESPEN Guidelines). In addition to routine blood measurement (i.e., ALAT, ASPAT, GGTP, creatinine, lipid profile), the following parameters were assessed: adiponectin, leptin, (hs)TNF-α, hsIL-6 and hsIL-10, TSH, NT-proBNP, serum vitamin B12 concentration, and tHcy.

To facilitate the rational use of drugs it is important to assess their prescription patterns over time. This study aims to evaluate doctors' prescribing patterns of antihypertensive drugs for drug-naïve patients in South Korea.
Methods: The claims data of the Korean National Health Insurance Research Database from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2015 were analyzed. The data virtually cover the entire South Korean population. Antihypertensive drugs were further subdivided into angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers (BBs), and thiazide diuretics. The prescription pattern of antihypertensive drugs and associated factors were assessed according to the patients' characteristics, including associated comorbidities.
Results: A total of 2,919,162 subjects had started taking antihypertension medications during the study period. ARB was the most frequently prescribed drug (51.6%) followed by CCB (45.0%), BB (18.5%), diuretics (17.0%), and ACEi (11.7%). Most patients were prescribed with monotherapy (66.7%) rather than combination therapy (33.3%), and CCB was the most frequently prescribed monotherapy drug (25.7%). For combination therapy, ARB + CCB was the most frequently prescribed combination, and the prescription frequency was found to be increasing. In patients prescribed with combination therapy, most had been prescribed single-pill fixed-dose combination.
Conclusion: We identified the physicians' prescription patterns of antihypertensive drugs for treatment-naïve patients. The findings of this study can lead to a rational, evidence-based, and cost-effective improvement of prescription patterns in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-19<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534797">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication by an anti-migraine agent, flunarizine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gap junctions (GJs), which consist of proteins called connexins, are intercellular channels that allow the passage of ions, second messengers, and small molecules. GJs and connexins are considered as emerging therapeutic targets for various diseases. Previously, we screened numerous compounds using our recently developed iodide yellow fluorescent protein gap junctional intercellular communication (I-YFP GJIC) assay and found that flunarizine (FNZ), used for migraine prophylaxis and as an add-on therapy for epilepsy, inhibits GJIC in LN215 human glioma cells. In this study, we confirmed that FNZ inhibits GJIC using the I-YFP GJIC assay. We demonstrated that FNZ inhibits GJ activities via a mechanism that is independent of calcium channels and dopaminergic D2, histaminergic H1, or 5-HT receptors. In addition, we showed that FNZ significantly increases connexin 43 (Cx43) phosphorylation on the cell surface, but does not alter the total amount of Cx43. The beneficial effects of FNZ on migraines and epilepsy might be related to GJ inhibition.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513635">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Serratia Liver Abscess Infection and Cardiomyopathy in a Patient with Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND Liver abscesses remain difficult to diagnose and treat. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and immunodeficiency. The majority are pyogenic, resulting from bacterial infection. Research identifies species in the Serratia genus as the cause of pyogenic liver abscesses in only 0.25% of cases and only 1 Serratia species in each case appears to have been identified. To the best of our knowledge, the present case report is the first to involve overlapping Serratia species in a single liver abscess infection that induced cardiomyopathy. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department (ED) for severe generalized weakness. Initial test results indicated a diagnosis of microcytic anemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heart failure. A computed tomography scan showed a 10-cm rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right hepatic lobe. Fluid drained from the suspected abscess tested positive for Serratia marcescens and Streptococcus viridans. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole, which she tolerated well. The abscess decreased to less than 9.8 mm. Twenty-one weeks after discharge, the patient received a cholecystectomy. Fluid drained from the residual abscess cultured positive for a different Serratia species, S. odorifera. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes mellitus and acute cholecystitis were key factors in the initial infections and abscess. We also suspect this is a rare case of cardiomyopathy induced by a Serratia infection. The source of the Serratia odorifera is less certain, as it postdates placement of a percutaneous drain, raising the potential for a nosocomial infection but not precluding the possibility that both Serratia species were previously present.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-11<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506419">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Adaptive substitutions underlying cardiac glycoside insensitivity in insects exhibit epistasis in vivo.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Predicting how species will respond to selection pressures requires understanding the factors that constrain their evolution.

These near perfect substitutes, which are termed as "biosimilars", do not need to undergo intense clinical trials for their approval. However, they are mandated to produce identical similarity from their reference biologics in terms of clinical safety and efficacy. As such, these biosimilar products promise to foster unprecedented access to a wide range of life-saving biologics. However, seeing this promise be fulfilled requires the development of biosimilars to be augmented with product trust, predictable regulatory frameworks, and sustainable policies. It is vital for healthcare and marketing professionals to understand the critical challenges surrounding biosimilar use and implement informed clinical and commercial decisions. A proper framework of pharmacovigilance, education, and scientific exchange for biologics and biosimilars would ensure a dramatic rise in healthcare access and market sustainability. This paper seeks to collate and review all relevant published intelligence of the health and business potential of biosimilars. In doing so, it provides a visualization of the essential steps that are required to be taken for global biosimilar acceptance.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450637">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunologic adverse reactions of β-blockers and the skin.<br><b>Abstract:</b> β-Blockers are a widely utilised class of medication. They have been in use for a variety of systemic disorders including hypertension, heart failure and intention tremors. Their use in dermatology has garnered growing interest with the discovery of their therapeutic effects in the treatment of haemangiomas, their potential positive effects in wound healing, Kaposi sarcoma, melanoma and pyogenic granuloma, and, more recently, pemphigus. Since β-blockers are deployed in a variety of disorders, which have cutaneous co-morbidities such as psoriasis, their pertinence to dermatologists cannot be overstated. Likewise, β-blockers, like any other drug category, carry risks of side effects, some of which are dermatologic. These include triggering and exacerbation of psoriasis, psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis, anaphylaxis, contact dermatitis, occupational contact dermatitis, Raynaud's disease, alopecia, lichen planus-like drug eruption, hyperhydrosis and vitiligo. While recent articles have focussed on the positive uses of β-blockers, it may also be wise to call our attention to the potential dermatologic adverse effects that may follow β-blocker use, as well as possible therapeutic approaches to these. This short review will focus on those dermatoses resulting from β-blocker use, which have an immunologic basis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384329">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Associations Between Headache-Free Days and Patient-Reported Outcomes Among Migraine Patients: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Survey Data in Europe.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Migraine imposes a substantial burden on patients, society, and healthcare systems. This study aimed to assess the associations between the number of headache-free days (HFDs) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) in patients with migraine in the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom).
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study collected survey responses from adults aged ≥ 18 years from the 2017 National Health and Wellness Survey (N = 62,000). Migraine patients with a physician's diagnosis of migraine and who had experienced at least 4 monthly headache days in the prior month were included (N = 1569). Number of HFDs was compared with Short-Form 12-Item Survey Instrument, version 2 (SF-12v2) physical and mental component summary scores (PCS and MCS), Short-Form-6D (SF-6D) and EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) scores, WPAI, and HRU in migraine patients. Correlation analyses were conducted to test the bivariate associations, whereas generalized linear models were used for multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: An increase of 1 HFD was associated with average increases of 0.171, 0.306, 0.003, and 0.008 points for MCS, PCS, SF-6D utility score, and EQ-5D index score, respectively (p < 0.001 for all). Extrapolating the results to a tenfold increase in monthly HFDs corresponded to clinically meaningful increases in PCS and EQ-5D scores. An increase of 1 HFD was associated with expected average decreases in absenteeism of 3.9% and presenteeism of 2.1%. Further, an increase of 1 HFD was associated with expected decreases in HCP visits and neurologist visits of 1.0% and 4.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An increase in the number of HFDs was associated with better health-related outcomes in patients suffering from migraine. Further, the results demonstrate a need for more effective treatments that can reduce migraine frequency and thus improve HRQoL, increase work productivity, and reduce both activity impairment and HRU.

It is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system, predominantly in cell bodies of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). It is the most potent vasodilator known to date and has inotropic and chronotropic effects. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, our laboratory and other research groups established the protective role of α-CGRP in various cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, experimental hypertension, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R injury). α-CGRP acts as a depressor to attenuate the rise in blood pressure in three different models of experimental hypertension: (1) DOC-salt, (2) subtotal nephrectomy-salt, and (3) L-NAME-induced hypertension during pregnancy. Subcutaneous administration of α-CGRP lowers the blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive humans and rodents. Recent studies also demonstrated that an α-CGRP analog, acylated α-CGRP, with extended half-life (~7 h) reduces blood pressure in Ang-II-induced hypertensive mouse, and protects against abdominal aortic constriction (AAC)-induced heart failure. Together, these studies suggest that α-CGRP, native or a modified form, may be a potential therapeutic agent to treat patients suffering from cardiac diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-17<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312143">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Traumatic Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Patient with Extensive Coronary Artery Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with cardiovascular symptoms not only following emotional trauma but also following motor vehicle accidents.

This activation ends up in the generation of Central Nervous System (CNS) Hemangioblastomas among other tumours along the lifespan of the patient. Nowadays, only surgery has been proven efficient as therapy since the systemic attempts have failed. Propranolol, a non-specific β1-and β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, was recently designated as the first therapeutic (orphan) drug for VHL disease. Nevertheless, its β1 affinity provokes the decrease in blood pressure, being not recommended for low or regular blood pressure VHL patients. In order to overcome the β1-drawback, the properties of a high specific β2-adrenergic receptor blocker named ICI-118,551 have been studied. ICI-118,551 was able to decrease Hemangioblastomas cell viability in a specific manner, by triggering apoptosis. Moreover, ICI-118,551 also impaired the nuclear internalization of HIF-1α in Hemangioblastomas and hypoxic primary endothelial cells, reducing significantly the activation of HIF-target genes and halting the tumour-related angiogenic processes. In this work, we demonstrate the therapeutical properties of ICI-118,551 in VHL-derived CNS-Hemangioblastoma primary cultures, becoming a promising drug for VHL disease and other HIF-related diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296894">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Use of big data in drug development for precision medicine: an update.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Introduction: Big-data-driven drug development resources and methodologies have been evolving with ever-expanding data from large-scale biological experiments, clinical trials, and medical records from participants in data collection initiatives. The enrichment of biological- and clinical-context-specific large-scale data has enabled computational inference more relevant to real-world biomedical research, particularly identification of therapeutic targets and drugs for specific diseases and clinical scenarios.
Areas covered: Here we overview recent progresses made in the fields: new big-data-driven approach to therapeutic target discovery, candidate drug prioritization, inference of clinical toxicity, and machine-learning methods in drug discovery.
Expert opinion: In the near future, much larger volumes and complex datasets for precision medicine will be generated, e.g., individual and longitudinal multi-omic, and direct-to-consumer datasets. Closer collaborations between experts with different backgrounds would also be required to better translate analytic results into prognosis and treatment in the clinical practice. Meanwhile, cloud computing with protected patient privacy would become more routine analytic practice to fill the gaps within data integration along with the advent of big-data.

Given the limited number of efficacious treatments outside of hormone replacement and the overall burden of continued symptomatic disease, this pilot study was designed to determine the efficacy of a multi-disciplinary diet and lifestyle intervention for improving the quality of life, clinical symptom burden, and thyroid function in a population of middle-aged women with HT. Materials and methods The study recruited 17 normal or overweight (body mass index (BMI) <29.9) female subjects between the ages of 20 and 45 with a prior diagnosis of HT. The 17 women participated in a 10-week online health coaching program focused on the implementation of a phased elimination diet known as the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP). The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine's Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) were used to measure the participant's health-related quality of life (HRQL) and clinical symptom burden, respectively, before and after the 10-week program. The participants completed serologic testing that included a complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, complete metabolic profile (CMP), thyroid function tests, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total and free T4, and total and free T3, thyroid antibodies, including thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TGA), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).  Results Sixteen women (n = 16) completed the SF-36 and MSQ before and after the 10-week program. There was a statistically significant improvement in HRQL as measured by all eight subscales of the SF-36 with the most marked improvements noted in the physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, vitality, and general health subscales. The clinical symptom burden, as measured by the MSQ, decreased significantly from an average of 92 (SD 25) prior to the program to 29 (SD 20) after the program. There were no statistically significant changes noted in any measure of thyroid function, including TSH, free and total T4, free and total T3 (n = 12), as well as thyroid antibodies (n = 14). Inflammation, as measured by hs-CRP (n = 14), was noted to significantly decrease by 29% (p = 0.0219) from an average of 1.63 mg/L (SD 1.72) pre-intervention to 1.15 mg/L (SD 1.31) post-intervention. Conclusions Our study suggests that an online diet and lifestyle program facilitated by a multi-disciplinary team can significantly improve HRQL and symptom burden in middle-aged female subjects with HT. While there were no statistically significant changes noted in thyroid function or thyroid antibodies, the study's findings suggest that AIP may decrease systemic inflammation and modulate the immune system as evidenced by a decrease in mean hs-CRP and changes in white blood cell (WBC) counts. Given the improvements seen in the HRQL and participants' symptom burden as well as markers of immune activity and inflammation, further studies in larger populations implementing AIP as part of a multi-disciplinary diet and lifestyle program are warranted.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-05<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275780">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Evaluation of Vitamin D Levels and Response to Therapy of Childhood Migraine.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are related with many neurological diseases such as migraine. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pediatric migraine is associated with vitamin D deficiency and the effect of vitamin D therapy on the frequency, duration, severity of migraine attacks, and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined the patients' levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-OH vitamin D of 92 pediatric migraine patients. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, which had low vitamin D levels and received vitamin D therapy, and group 2, which had normal vitamin D levels and did not receive vitamin D therapy. Migraine severity measured by the visual analog scale (VAS), migraine frequency, and duration as well as scores on the PedMIDAS questionnaire were compared with regard to the 25-OH vitamin D levels. In addition, pre- and posttreatment pedMIDAS scores, VAS, migraine frequency, and duration were compared with baseline values.
RESULTS: A total of 34.7% patients had vitamin D insufficiency (vitamin D levels between 10 and 20 ng/mL), whereas 10.8% had vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D levels < 10 ng/mL). Migraine frequency, migraine duration, and PedMIDAS scores were significantly higher in the group 1 than group 2 (
CONCLUSION: We found a marked correlation between pediatric migraine and vitamin D levels.

Hence, we investigated the mechanism by which warfarin may affect migraine symptoms and whether there is a change in migraine symptomology in patients initiating oral anticoagulants, most commonly warfarin. The effects of warfarin on human platelet aggregation and secretion as well as platelet-induced rat cerebral artery vasoconstriction were studied. A survey of migraine and symptom change after starting or stopping oral anticoagulants was also conducted. Warfarin inhibited platelet aggregation and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. Warfarin-inhibited platelet secretion products constricted middle cerebral arteries from male but not from female rats. For the survey, patient demographic information, migraine and medical history, and Migraine Disability Assessment Score (MIDAS) changes were collected. Out of 175 consenting, 40 respondents met the criteria for migraine and completed the survey. A total of 11 patients reported migraine symptom change, all coinciding with starting warfarin. Of those having symptom and MIDAS improvement, most were female with migraines with aura, whereas those worsening were male with fewer having migraine with aura. Of those reporting migraine symptom change with warfarin, female sex may be associated with improved MIDAS, and those experiencing an aura component are more likely to report a symptom change. Warfarin-mediated symptom improvement in females may occur due to inhibition of platelet 5-HT secretion and a lower sensitivity of female cerebral blood vessels to platelet-derived 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-01<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259301">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Graphene-Based Sensors for Human Health Monitoring.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Since the desire for real-time human health monitoring as well as seamless human-machine interaction is increasing rapidly, plenty of research efforts have been made to investigate wearable sensors and implantable devices in recent years.

There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of CD over the last 50 years and many patients remain undiagnosed. Diagnostic testing, including serology and biopsy, should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The diagnosis of CD is based on a combination of clinical, serological and histopathological data. In a group of children the diagnosis may be made without biopsy if strict criteria are available. The treatment for CD is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation and follow-up. Slow-responsiveness occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms necessitate a review of the original diagnosis, exclude alternative diagnoses, confirm dietary adherence (dietary review and serology) and follow-up biopsy. In addition, evaluation to exclude complications of CD, such as refractory CD or lymphoma, should be performed. The guideline also deals with other gluten-related disorders, such as dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a cutaneous manifestation of CD characterized by granular IgA deposits in the dermal papillae. The skin lesions clear with gluten withdrawal. Also, less well-defined conditions such as non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and gluten-sensitive neurological manifestations, such as ataxia, have been addressed. Newer therapeutic modalities for CD are being studied in clinical trials but are not yet approved for use in practice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31210940">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Macronutrient metabolism by the human gut microbiome: major fermentation by-products and their impact on host health.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The human gut microbiome is a critical component of digestion, breaking down complex carbohydrates, proteins, and to a lesser extent fats that reach the lower gastrointestinal tract. This process results in a multitude of microbial metabolites that can act both locally and systemically (after being absorbed into the bloodstream). The impact of these biochemicals on human health is complex, as both potentially beneficial and potentially toxic metabolites can be yielded from such microbial pathways, and in some cases, these effects are dependent upon the metabolite concentration or organ locality. The aim of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of how macronutrient metabolism by the gut microbiome influences human health. Metabolites to be discussed include short-chain fatty acids and alcohols (mainly yielded from monosaccharides); ammonia, branched-chain fatty acids, amines, sulfur compounds, phenols, and indoles (derived from amino acids); glycerol and choline derivatives (obtained from the breakdown of lipids); and tertiary cycling of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Key microbial taxa and related disease states will be referred to in each case, and knowledge gaps that could contribute to our understanding of overall human wellness will be identified.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-14<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31196177">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Drug and Device News.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Approvals, new indications and formulations, and safety issues.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160866">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Retrospective Case Series of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treated with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Returning veterans are frequently diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Other possible antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-related clinical manifestations include cardiac involvement. The heart can be involved through immune mediated and /or thrombotic mechanisms. Mortality due to cardiovascular problems is elevated in APS. However, the cardiovascular risk in patients with primary APS (PAPS) compared with lupus-related APS is yet to be established. Cardiac symptoms of APS include valve abnormalities (thickening and vegetations), coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and intracardiac thrombi. Heart valve lesions are the most common cardiac manifestation, observed in approximately one third of PAPS patients and usually do not cause hemodynamic significance. Deposits of immunoglobulins including anticardiolipin (aCL), and of complement components, are commonly observed in affected heart valves from these patients. This suggests that an inflammatory process is initiated by aPL deposition, eventually resulting in the formation of valvular lesion. aPL may have a direct role in the atherosclerotic process via induction of endothelial activation. Multiple traditional and autoimmune-inflammatory risk factors are involved in triggering an expedited atherosclerotic arterial disease evident in APS. It is imperative to increase the efforts in early diagnosis, control of risk factors and close follow-up, in the attempt to minimize cardiovascular risk in APS. Clinicians should bear in mind that a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach is of paramount importance in these patients. This article reviews the cardiac detriments of APS, including treatment recommendations for each cardiac complication.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134062">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The role of concordant and discordant comorbidities on performance of self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-22<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31114271">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in association with dapagliflozin use after gastric sleeve surgery in a patient with type II diabetes mellitus.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) can be associated with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (eDKA).

Our study aim was to undertake a scoping review to synthesize evidence from quantitative studies that have investigated the relationship between built environment and chronic health conditions, self-reported health and quality of life, and injuries in the Canadian adult population.
METHODS: From January to March 2017, we searched 13 databases to identify peer-reviewed quantitative studies from all years that estimated associations between the objectively-measured built environment and health conditions in Canadian adults. Studies under-taken within urban settings only were included. Relevant studies were catalogued and synthesized in relation to their reported study and sample design, and health outcome and built environment features.
RESULTS: Fifty-five articles met the inclusion criteria, 52 of which were published after 2008. Most single province studies were undertaken in Ontario (n = 22), Quebec (n = 12), and Alberta (n = 7). Associations between the built environment features and 11 broad health outcomes emerged from the review, including injury (n = 19), weight status (n = 19), cardiovascular disease (n = 5), depression/anxiety (n = 5), diabetes (n = 5), mortality (n = 4), self-rated health (n = 2), chronic conditions (n = 2), metabolic condi-tions (n = 2), quality of life (n = 1), and cancer (n = 1). Consistent evidence for associations between aggregate built environment indicators (e.g., walkability) and diabetes and weight and between connectivity and route features (e.g., transportation route, trails, pathways, sidewalks, street pattern, intersections, route characteristics) and injury were found. Evidence for greenspace, parks and recreation features impacting multiple health outcomes was also found.
CONCLUSION: Within the Canadian context, the built environment is associated with a range of chronic health conditions and injury in adults, but the evidence to date has limitations. More research on the built environment and health incorporating rigorous study designs are needed to provide stronger causal evidence to inform policy and practice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-15<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31091062">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> How to integrate monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor in daily clinical practice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Migraine is a major public health issue associated with significant morbidity, considerable negative impact on quality of life, and significant socioeconomic burden. Preventive treatments are required to reduce the occurrence and the severity of acute attacks and to minimize the use of abortive medications and the associate risk of drug-related adverse events, as well as the onset of medication-overuse headache and chronification of migraine. We performed a review of all available evidence on the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor for the preventive treatment of migraine to provide evidence-based guidance on their use in clinical practice. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor are mechanism-specific drugs for the preventive treatment of migraine. Double-blind randomized clinical trials have shown that monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor are effective across all the spectrum of migraine patients who require prevention and have a good safety and tolerability profile. Nevertheless, high costs limit the affordability of those drugs at the moment.
CONCLUSIONS: Specificity, long half-life, efficacy, tolerability, and ease of use make monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor an appealing treatment option for migraine prevention. Optimal strategies to manage treatment over time still need to be clarified with real-life data.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-07<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060490">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Reliability of Medical History Reporting in Older Adults With and Without Cognitive Impairment.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Clinical diagnosis of cognitive disorders depends on accurate reporting of medical history, yet little is known about the reliability and the validity of such reports, particularly in older patients with and without cognitive impairment.

Conventional drugs have poor blood circulation time and are not stable or compatible with the biological system. Nanomaterials, with their exceptional structural properties, have gained significance as promising materials for the development of novel therapeutics. Nanofibers with unique physiochemical and biological properties have gained significant attention in the field of health care and biomedical research. The choice of a wide variety of materials for nanofiber fabrication, along with the release of therapeutic payload in sustained and controlled release patterns, make nanofibers an ideal material for drug delivery research. Electrospinning is the conventional method for fabricating nanofibers with different morphologies and is often used for the mass production of nanofibers. This review highlights the recent advancements in the use of nanofibers for the delivery of therapeutic drugs, nucleic acids and growth factors. A detailed mechanism for fabricating different types of nanofiber produced from electrospinning, and factors influencing nanofiber generation, are discussed.

The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders.
METHODS: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247-308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million [8·8-9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34-44] and DALYs by 15% [9-21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26-30] and DALYs by 27% [24-31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6-46·1]), migraine (16·3% [11·7-20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0-12·1]), and meningitis (7·9% [6·6-10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 [1·05-1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5-90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8-35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8-17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable).
INTERPRETATION: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

We investigated pupil responses to a light flash using dynamic pupillometry in glaucoma patients to assess autonomic nervous system status. In total, 97 glaucoma patients, including 21 eyes of 21 glaucoma patients with cardiac autonomic dysfunction, were enrolled. Pupil reactions were assessed using 1 flash of white light after 2 minutes of dark adaptation and recorded using dynamic pupillometry. Changes in the radius of the pupil were evaluated as a function of several time-dependent and pupil/iris (P/I) diameter ratio parameters. Autonomic function was assessed using a cardiac heart-rate-variability test which performs 5 autonomic function tests and classifies patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN). Comparison of pupil parameters between eyes with and without disc hemorrhage indicated larger P/I ratios in darkness, greater changes in the P/I ratio during examination, shorter latency to plateau, and shorter duration of constriction in eyes with disc hemorrhages. A comparison of pupil parameters between eyes with and without CAN showed larger P/I ratios in darkness, larger P/I ratios at maximum constriction, and prolonged latency to maximum constriction. The presence of CAN was significantly related to the P/I ratio in darkness and the latency of maximum constriction. Using dynamic pupillometry, we found that glaucoma patients with CAN dysfunction have larger baseline pupils in darkness and different constriction responses to light. Assessing the pupils might be a good method of identifying patients with autonomic dysfunction.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882629">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Four-Cluster Spectrum of Mind-Body Interrelationships: An Integrative Model.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Despite the shift toward a biopsychosocial paradigm of medicine, many physicians and mental health professionals (MHPs) find it difficult to treat patients with psycho-somatic disorders. This situation is particularly troublesome due to the high prevalence of these conditions. Although progress has been made over the last few decades in understanding mechanisms underlying the mind-body relationship, disparities remain between research and its clinical implementation. One possible reason for this is the lack of a comprehensive, agreed-upon model that incorporates a biopsychosocial framework and is rooted in an understanding of the various psychobiological pathways. Such a model would enable better communication between physicians and MHPs, allowing them to provide coordinated, stratified treatment. In this paper, four archetypal case studies, together with standard care options are presented to illustrate the current state of affairs.

Research on multimorbidity has predominantly focused on older adults and few studies have examined multimorbidity in middle-aged people. The objectives of this study were to: 1) examine the prevalence of multimorbidity among middle-aged Canadians; and 2) examine the association between lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity) and multimorbidity in this age group.
METHODS: In this analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) baseline data, we extracted data from 29,841 participants aged 45-64 years from a database of 51,338 people aged 45-85 years. Self-reported data on 27 chronic physical health conditions were used to derive different multimorbidity definitions. We estimated the prevalence of 3+ to 5+ chronic physical health conditions in different subgroups for descriptive purposes. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, and multimorbidity using a 3+ multimorbidity case definition.
RESULT: We found that 39.6% (99% CI 38.4-40.7) of participants had three or more chronic conditions with a mean number of chronic condition of 2.41 (99% CI 2.37-2.46). The prevalence of multimorbidity increased with age from 29.7% in the 45-49-year-old age group to 52% in individuals aged 60-64 years. The prevalence of 4+ and 5+ chronic conditions was 24.5 and 14.2% respectively. Analyses indicated that female sex and low income were associated with higher odds of multimorbidity, whereas daily or weekly alcohol intake were associated with lower odds of multimorbidity. Exercise was not associated with multimorbidity. Results were similar when analyses were conducted separately for women and men.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity is not limited to older adults, but is a common phenomenon among middle-aged people.

It has been speculated that such short, successive periods of muscle disuse may be largely responsible for the age-related loss of muscle mass throughout the lifespan.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a single intramuscular injection of nandrolone decanoate prior to immobilization can attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength in vivo in humans.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty healthy (22 ± 1 years) men were subjected to 7 days of one-legged knee immobilization by means of a full leg cast with (NAD, n = 15) or without (CON, n = 15) prior intramuscular nandrolone decanoate injection (200 mg).
MEASURES: Before and immediately after immobilization, quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) (by means of single-slice computed tomography (CT) scans of the upper leg) and one-legged knee extension strength (one-repetition maximum [1-RM]) were assessed for both legs. Furthermore, muscle biopsies from the immobilized leg were taken before and after immobilization to assess type I and type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area.
RESULTS: Quadriceps muscle CSA decreased during immobilization in both CON and NAD (-6 ± 1% and -6 ± 1%, respectively; main effect of time P<0.01), with no differences between the groups (time × treatment interaction, P = 0.59). Leg muscle strength declined following immobilization (-6 ± 2% in CON and -7 ± 3% in NAD; main effect of time, P<0.05), with no differences between groups (time × treatment interaction, P = 0.55).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report that nandrolone decanoate administration does not preserve skeletal muscle mass and strength during a short period of leg immobilization in vivo in humans.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-01-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689637">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cancer-associated stroke: Pathophysiology, detection and management (Review).<br><b>Abstract:</b> Numerous types of cancer have been shown to be associated with either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. In this review, the epidemiology and pathophysiology of stroke in cancer patients is discussed, while providing vital information on the diagnosis and management of patients with cancer and stroke. Cancer may mediate stroke pathophysiology either directly or via coagulation disorders that establish a state of hypercoagulation, as well as via infections. Cancer treatment options, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery have all been shown to aggravate the risk of stroke as well. The clinical manifestation varies greatly depending upon the underlying cause; however, in general, cancer‑associated strokes tend to appear as multifocal in neuroimaging. Furthermore, several serum markers have been identified, such as high D‑Dimer levels and fibrin degradation products. Managing cancer patients with stroke is a delicate matter. The cancer should not be considered a contraindication in applying thrombolysis and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) administration, since the risk of hemorrhage in cancer patients has not been reported to be higher than that in the general population. Anticoagulation, on the contrary, should be carefully examined. Clinicians should weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation treatment for each patient individually; the new oral anticoagulants appear promising; however, low‑molecular‑weight heparin remains the first choice. On the whole, stroke is a serious and not a rare complication of malignancy. Clinicians should be adequately trained to handle these patients efficiently.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-01-10<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30628661">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6643206/">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Discovering and producing conditionally active biologic proteins in the same eukaryotic cell production hosts<br><b>Abstract:</b> A method of preparing a conditionally active biologic protein by selecting a wild-type biologic protein, evolving the DNA which encodes the wild-type biologic protein using one or more evolutionary techniques to create mutant DNAs, expressing the mutant DNAs in a eukaryotic cell production host to obtain a mutant protein, subjecting the mutant protein and the wild-type protein to an assay under a normal physiological condition and to an assay under an aberrant condition, selecting a conditionally active mutant protein which exhibits at least one of: (a) a decrease in activity in the assay at the normal physiological condition compared to the wild-type protein, and (b) an increase in activity in the assay under the aberrant condition compared to the wild-type protein; and producing the conditionally active biologic protein in the same eukaryotic cell production host used in the expression step.<br><b>Patent date:</b> December 24, 2019<br><b>File date:</b> September 3, 2015<br><b><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=(%22heart+failure%22+AND+%22migraines%22)&OS="heart+failure"+AND+"migraines"&RS=("heart+failure"+AND+"migraines")">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Compositions for oral drug administration<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present invention provides compositions and methods and for increasing the bioavailability of therapeutic agents in a subject.
