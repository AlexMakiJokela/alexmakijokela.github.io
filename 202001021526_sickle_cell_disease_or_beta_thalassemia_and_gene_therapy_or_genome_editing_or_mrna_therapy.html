However, the key pathological processes underlying cyst development and exacerbation in pre-symptomatic stages remain unknown, because rodent models do not recapitulate critical disease phenotypes, including disease onset in heterozygotes. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generate ADPKD models with PKD1 mutations in cynomolgus monkeys. As in humans and mice, near-complete PKD1 depletion induces severe cyst formation mainly in collecting ducts. Importantly, unlike in mice, PKD1 heterozygote monkeys exhibit cyst formation perinatally in distal tubules, possibly reflecting the initial pathology in humans. Many monkeys in these models survive after cyst formation, and cysts progress with age. Furthermore, we succeed in generating selective heterozygous mutations using allele-specific targeting. We propose that our models elucidate the onset and progression of ADPKD, which will serve as a critical basis for establishing new therapeutic strategies, including drug treatments.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Tomoyuki Tsukiyama, Kenichi Kobayashi, Masataka Nakaya, Chizuru Iwatani, Yasunari Seita, Hideaki Tsuchiya, Jun Matsushita, Kahoru Kitajima, Ikuo Kawamoto, Takahiro Nakagawa, Koji Fukuda, Teppei Iwakiri, Hiroyuki Izumi, Iori Itagaki, Shinji Kume, Hiroshi Maegawa, Ryuichi Nishinakamura, Saori Nishio, Shinichiro Nakamura, Akihiro Kawauchi, Masatsugu Ema<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822676">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Development of a forward-oriented therapeutic lentiviral vector for hemoglobin disorders.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is being evaluated for hemoglobin disorders including sickle cell disease (SCD). Therapeutic globin vectors have demanding requirements including high-efficiency transduction at the HSC level and high-level, erythroid-specific expression with long-term persistence. The requirement of intron 2 for high-level β-globin expression dictates a reverse-oriented globin-expression cassette to prevent its loss from RNA splicing. Current reverse-oriented globin vectors can drive phenotypic correction, but they are limited by low vector titers and low transduction efficiencies. Here we report a clinically relevant forward-oriented β-globin-expressing vector, which has sixfold higher vector titers and four to tenfold higher transduction efficiency for long-term hematopoietic repopulating cells in humanized mice and rhesus macaques.

A potential treatment approach is to engineer the patient's own hematopoietic system to express high levels of the deficient enzyme, thereby correcting the biochemical defect and halting disease progression. Here, we present an efficient ex vivo genome editing approach using CRISPR-Cas9 that targets the lysosomal enzyme iduronidase to the CCR5 safe harbor locus in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The modified cells secrete supra-endogenous enzyme levels, maintain long-term repopulation and multi-lineage differentiation potential, and can improve biochemical and phenotypic abnormalities in an immunocompromised mouse model of Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. These studies provide support for the development of genome-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as a potential treatment for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The safe harbor approach constitutes a flexible platform for the expression of lysosomal enzymes making it applicable to other lysosomal storage disorders.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-07<br><b>Authors:</b> Natalia Gomez-Ospina, Samantha G Scharenberg, Nathalie Mostrel, Rasmus O Bak, Sruthi Mantri, Rolen M Quadros, Channabasavaiah B Gurumurthy, Ciaran Lee, Gang Bao, Carlos J Suarez, Shaukat Khan, Kazuki Sawamoto, Shunji Tomatsu, Nitin Raj, Laura D Attardi, Laure Aurelian, Matthew H Porteus<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492863">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficient base editing for multiple genes and loci in pigs using base editors.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cytosine base editors (CBEs) enable programmable C-to-T conversion without DNA double-stranded breaks and homology-directed repair in a variety of organisms, which exhibit great potential for agricultural and biomedical applications. However, all reported cases only involved C-to-T substitution at a single targeted genomic site. Whether C-to-T substitution is effective in multiple sites/loci has not been verified in large animals. Here, by using pigs, an important animal for agriculture and biomedicine, as the subjective animal, we showed that CBEs could efficiently induce C-to-T conversions at multiple sites/loci with the combination of three genes, including DMD, TYR, and LMNA, or RAG1, RAG2, and IL2RG, simultaneously, at the embryonic and cellular levels. CBEs also could disrupt genes (pol gene of porcine endogenous retrovirus) with dozens of copies by introducing multiple premature stop codons.

Building on our recent developing of a system able to package up to 100 copies of Cas9 mRNA in each lentivirus-like particle (LVLP) via the specific interaction between aptamer and aptamer-binding proteins (ABP), here we develop a lentiviral capsid-based bionanoparticle system, which allows efficient packaging of Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP). We show that replacing the Tetraloop of sgRNA scaffold with a com aptamer preserves the functions of the guide RNA, and the com-modified sgRNA can package Cas9/sgRNA RNP into lentivirus-like particles via the specific interactions between ABP and aptamer, and sgRNA and Cas9 protein. These RNP bionanoparticles generated Indels on different targets in different cells with efficiencies similar to or better than our recently described Cas9 mRNA LVLPs. The new system showed fast action and reduced off-target rates, and makes it more convenient and efficient in delivering Cas9 RNPs for transient Cas9 expression and efficient genome editing.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Pin Lyu, Parisa Javidi-Parsijani, Anthony Atala, Baisong Lu<br><b>Journal:</b> Nucleic Acids Res.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1362-4962<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.14<br><b>SJR:</b> 8.636<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299082">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The genetics of human hematopoiesis and its disruption in disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Hematopoiesis, or the process of blood cell production, is a paradigm of multi-lineage cellular differentiation that has been extensively studied, yet in many aspects remains incompletely understood. Nearly all clinically measured hematopoietic traits exhibit extensive variation and are highly heritable, underscoring the importance of genetic variation in these processes. This review explores how human genetics have illuminated our understanding of hematopoiesis in health and disease. The study of rare mutations in blood and immune disorders has elucidated novel roles for regulators of hematopoiesis and uncovered numerous important molecular pathways, as seen through examples such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia and the GATA2 deficiency syndromes. Additionally, population studies of common genetic variation have revealed mechanisms by which human hematopoiesis can be modulated. We discuss advances in functionally characterizing common variants associated with blood cell traits and discuss therapeutic insights, such as the discovery of BCL11A as a modulator of fetal hemoglobin expression. Finally, as genetic techniques continue to evolve, we discuss the prospects, challenges, and unanswered questions that lie ahead in this burgeoning field.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Erik L Bao, Aaron N Cheng, Vijay G Sankaran<br><b>Journal:</b> EMBO Mol Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-4684<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 10.28<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.033<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313878">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Positive Feedback Defines the Timing, Magnitude, and Robustness of Angiogenesis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Angiogenesis is driven by the coordinated collective branching of specialized leading "tip" and trailing "stalk" endothelial cells (ECs). While Notch-regulated negative feedback suppresses excessive tip selection, roles for positive feedback in EC identity decisions remain unexplored. Here, by integrating computational modeling with in vivo experimentation, we reveal that positive feedback critically modulates the magnitude, timing, and robustness of angiogenic responses. In silico modeling predicts that positive-feedback-mediated amplification of VEGF signaling generates an ultrasensitive bistable switch that underpins quick and robust tip-stalk decisions. In agreement, we define a positive-feedback loop exhibiting these properties in vivo, whereby Vegf-induced expression of the atypical tetraspanin, tm4sf18, amplifies Vegf signaling to dictate the speed and robustness of EC selection for angiogenesis. Consequently, tm4sf18 mutant zebrafish select fewer motile ECs and exhibit stunted hypocellular vessels with unstable tip identity that is severely perturbed by even subtle Vegfr attenuation. Hence, positive feedback spatiotemporally shapes the angiogenic switch to ultimately modulate vascular network topology.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Donna J Page, Raphael Thuret, Lakshmi Venkatraman, Tokiharu Takahashi, Katie Bentley, Shane P Herbert<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2211-1247<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.70<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.635<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189101">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Correction of IVS I-110(G>A) β-thalassemia by CRISPR/Cas-and TALEN-mediated disruption of aberrant regulatory elements in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Petros Patsali, Giandomenico Turchiano, Panayiota Papasavva, Marianna Romito, Constantinos C Loucari, Coralea Stephanou, Soteroulla Christou, Maria Sitarou, Claudio Mussolino, Tatjana I Cornu, Michael N Antoniou, Carsten W Lederer, Toni Cathomen, Marina Kleanthous<br><b>Journal:</b> Haematologica<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1592-8721<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.077<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004018">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Targeting sickle cell disease root-cause pathophysiology with small molecules.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The complex, frequently devastating, multi-organ pathophysiology of sickle cell disease has a single root cause: polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin. A logical approach to disease modification is, therefore, to interdict this root cause. Ideally, such interdiction would utilize small molecules that are practical and accessible for worldwide application. Two types of such small molecule strategies are actively being evaluated in the clinic. The first strategy intends to shift red blood cell precursor hemoglobin manufacturing away from sickle hemoglobin and towards fetal hemoglobin, which inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization by a number of mechanisms. The second strategy intends to chemically modify sickle hemoglobin directly in order to inhibit its polymerization. Important lessons have been learnt from the pre-clinical and clinical evaluations to date. Open questions remain, but this review summarizes the valuable experience and knowledge already gained, which can guide ongoing and future efforts for molecular mechanism-based, practical and accessible disease modification of sickle cell disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Yogen Saunthararajah<br><b>Journal:</b> Haematologica<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1592-8721<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.077<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399526">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sickle cell disease afflicts millions of people worldwide and approximately 100,000 Americans. Complications are myriad and arise as a result of complex pathological pathways 'downstream' to a point mutation in DNA, and include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia and pain, and ultimately risk of cumulative organ damage with reduced lifespan of affected individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies will be widely available to most patients with sickle cell disease. To date, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children, and significantly ameliorated by gene therapy in a handful of subjects who have only limited follow-up thus far. During a timespan in which over 20 agents were approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration, similar approval was granted for only two drugs for sickle cell disease (hydroxyurea and L-glutamine) despite the higher prevalence of sickle cell disease. This trajectory appears to be changing, as the lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry who, in the last decade, have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction, inhibition of intracellular HbS polymerization, inhibition of oxidant stress and inflammation, and perturbation of the activation of the endothelium and other blood components (e.g. platelets, white blood cells, coagulation proteins) involved in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. In this article, we present a crash-course review of disease-modifying approaches (minus hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) for patients with sickle cell disease currently, or recently, tested in clinical trials in the era following approval of hydroxyurea.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Marcus A Carden, Jane Little<br><b>Journal:</b> Haematologica<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1592-8721<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 7.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.077<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413089">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Structural and functional insights into the <br><b>Abstract:</b> The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 from <br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Zuo, Ashwini Zolekar, Kesavan Babu, Victor Jt Lin, Hamed S Hayatshahi, Rakhi Rajan, Yu-Chieh Wang, Jin Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361218">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Evaluation of Outcomes and Quality of Care in Children with Sickle Cell Disease Diagnosed by Newborn Screening: A Real-World Nation-Wide Study in France.<br><b>Abstract:</b> This study's objective was to assess, on a national scale, residual risks of death, major disease-related events, and quality of care during the first five years in children diagnosed at birth with sickle cell disease (SCD). Data were retrospectively collected from medical files of all children with SCD born between 2006-2010 in France. Out of 1792 eligible subjects, 1620 patients (71.8% SS or S/beta°-thalassemia -SB°-) had available follow-up data, across 69 centers. Overall probability of survival by five years was 98.9%, with 12/18 deaths related to SCD. Probability of overt stroke by five years in SS/SB° patients was 1.1%, while transcranial Doppler (TCD) was performed in 81% before three years of age. A total of 26 patients had meningitis/septicemia (pneumococcal in eight cases). Prophylactic penicillin was started at a median age of 2.2 months and 87% of children had received appropriate conjugate pneumococcal vaccination at one year. By five years, the probability of survival without SCD-related events was 10.7% for SS/SB° patients. In contrast, hydroxyurea was prescribed in 13.7% and bone marrow transplant performed in nine patients only. In this study, residual risks of severe complications were low, probably resulting from a good national TCD, vaccination, and healthcare system coverage. Nonetheless, burden of disease remained high, stressing the need for disease-modifying or curative therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Valentine Brousse, Cécile Arnaud, Emmanuelle Lesprit, Béatrice Quinet, Marie-Hélène Odièvre, Maryse Etienne-Julan, Cécile Guillaumat, Gisèle Elana, Marie Belloy, Nathalie Garnier, Abdourahim Chamouine, Cécile Dumesnil, Mariane De Montalembert, Corinne Pondarre, Françoise Bernaudin, Nathalie Couque, Emmanuelle Boutin, Josiane Bardakjian, Fatiha Djennaoui, Ghislaine Ithier, Malika Benkerrou, Isabelle Thuret<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581727">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder that leads to substantial morbidity and early mortality. Acute and chronic SCD-related complications increase with older age, and therapies are urgently needed to treat adults. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative therapy, but has been used less frequently in adults compared to children. This is, in part, due to (1) greater chronic organ damage, limiting tolerability to myeloablative conditioning regimens, (2) a higher rate of HSCT-related complications in adults versus children with SCD, and (3) limited coverage by public and private health insurance. Newer approaches using nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT regimens have demonstrated better safety and tolerability, with high rates of stable engraftment in SCD adults. This review will focus on the impacts of HSCT, using more contemporary approaches to SCD-related complications in adults.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Santosh L Saraf, Damiano Rondelli<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581479">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Why, Who, When, and How? Rationale for Considering Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children with Sickle Cell Disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Considering the progress made in the management of sickle cell disease during the past 30 years, along with the excellent results obtained with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), it is important to reexamine why, who, when and how to recommend allogeneic SCT in children with sickle cell disease. While sickle cell disease has a low risk of death in children and a high risk for morbidity during aging, SCT carries an early risk of death, graft-vs-host disease and infertility. Nevertheless, SCT offers at least 95% chance of cure with low risk of chronic graft-vs-host disease when a matched-sibling donor is available and the risks of infertility can be reduced by ovarian, sperm or testis cryopreservation. Thus, all available therapies such as hydroxyurea, transfusions and SCT should be presented to the parents, providers, and affected children and discussed with them from infancy. Furthermore, the use of these therapies should be adjusted to the severity of the disease and to local availabilities in order to choose the treatment offering the best benefit/risk ratio.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Françoise Bernaudin<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546720">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficient Delivery of MicroRNA and AntimiRNA Molecules Using an Argininocalix[4]arene Macrocycle.<br><b>Abstract:</b> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules acting as gene regulators by repressing translation or by inducing degradation of the target RNA transcripts. Altered expression of miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of many severe human diseases, opening new avenues in the field of therapeutic strategies, i.e., miRNA targeting or miRNA mimicking. In this context, the efficient and non-toxic delivery of premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules might be of great interest. The aim of the present paper is to determine whether an argininocalix[4]arene is able to efficiently deliver miRNA, premiRNA, and antimiRNA molecules to target cells, preserving their biological activity. This study points out that (1) the toxicity of argininocalix[4]arene 1 is low, and it can be proposed for long-term treatment of target cells, being that this feature is a pre-requisite for the development of therapeutic protocols; (2) the delivery of premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules is efficient, being higher when compared with reference gold standards available; and (3) the biological activity of the premiRNAs and antimiRNAs is maintained. This was demonstrated using the argininocalix[4]arene 1 in miRNA therapeutic approaches performed on three well-described experimental model systems: (1) the induction of apoptosis by antimiR-221 in glioma U251 cells; (2) the induction of apoptosis by premiR-124 in U251 cells; and (3) the inhibition of pro-inflammatory IL-8 and IL-6 genes in cystic fibrosis IB3-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that the argininocalix[4]arene 1 should be considered a very useful delivery system for efficient transfer to target cells of both premiRNA and antimiRNA molecules, preserving their biological activity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Gasparello, Michela Lomazzi, Chiara Papi, Elisabetta D'Aversa, Francesco Sansone, Alessandro Casnati, Gaetano Donofrio, Roberto Gambari, Alessia Finotti<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Ther Nucleic Acids<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2162-2531<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.011<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31733592">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Viagra Enables Efficient, Single-Day Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a curative treatment for a variety of blood and immune disorders. Currently available methods to obtain donor HSCs are suboptimal, and the limited supply of donor HSCs hampers the success and availability of HSC transplantation therapies. We recently showed that manipulation of vascular integrity can be employed to induce HSC mobilization from the bone marrow to the blood stream, facilitating non-invasive collection of HSCs. Here, we tested whether FDA-approved vasodilators are capable of mobilizing HSCs. We found that a rapid, 2-h regimen of a single oral dose of Viagra (sildenafil citrate) combined with a single injection of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 leads to efficient HSC mobilization at levels rivaling the standard-of-care 5-day regimen of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF/Filgrastim/Neupogen).

We observed efficient marking of multiple macrophage subsets, including CNS-associated myeloid cells, suggesting that HSPC-derived macrophages are a viable approach to target gene-modified cells to tissues. Gene-marked cells in the CNS were unique from gene-marked cells at any other physiological sites including peripheral blood.

This first-in-human, Phase I study (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu; EudraCT no. 2017-003395-31) assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single- and multiple-ascending doses (SAD and MAD) of the oral ferroportin inhibitor, VIT-2763, in healthy volunteers. Participants received VIT-2763 5/15/60/120/240 mg or placebo in the SAD phase and VIT-2763 60/120 mg once daily, VIT-2763 60/120 mg twice daily, or placebo for 7 days in the MAD phase. Seventy-two participants completed treatment. VIT-2763 was well tolerated and demonstrated a similar safety profile to the placebo. There were no serious or severe adverse events, or discontinuations due to adverse events. VIT-2763 absorption was relatively fast, with detectable levels 15 to 30 minutes post-dose. Following multiple dosing there was no apparent change in absorption and accumulation was minimal. Mean elimination half-life was 1.9 to 5.3 hours following single dosing, and 2.1 to 3.8 hours on Day 1 and 2.6 to 5.3 hours on Day 7, following repeated dosing. There was a temporary decrease in mean serum iron levels with VIT-2763 single doses ≥60 mg and all multiple doses; mean calculated transferrin saturation (only assessed following multiple dosing) also temporarily decreased. A shift in mean serum hepcidin peaks followed administration of all iron-lowering doses of VIT-2763. This effect was less pronounced after 7 days of multiple dosing (aside from with 120 mg once daily).

Spleen and liver are the target tissues of Fe@Si-NPs, and 20 nm of Fe@Si-NPs showed a possible longer blood circulation time. Quantitative biochemical analysis showed that the alterations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid (UA) were correlated to some extent with the sizes of Fe@Si-NPs. The untargeted metabolomic analyses of tissue metabolomes (kidney, liver, lung, and spleen) indicated that different sizes of Fe@Si-NPs were involved in the different biochemical mechanisms. LDH, formate, uric acid, and GSH related metabolites were suggested as sensitive indicators for the size-dependent toxic effects of Fe@Si-NPs. The findings from serum biochemical analysis and metabolomic analysis corroborate each other. Thus we proposed a toxicity hypothesis that size-dependent NAD depletion may occur in vivo in response to nanoparticle exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first report that links size-dependent biological effects of nanoparticles with in vivo NAD depletion in rats.
CONCLUSION: The integrated metabolomic approach is an effective tool to understand physiological responses to the size-specific properties of nanoparticles. Our results can provide a direction for the future biological applications of Fe@Si-NPs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Jinquan Li, Zhongxue Yuan, Huili Liu, Jianghua Feng, Zhong Chen<br><b>Journal:</b> J Nanobiotechnology<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1477-3155<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.255<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31870377">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Applications of Genome Editing Technology in Animal Disease Modeling and Gene Therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Genome editing technology is a technique for targeted genetic modifications, enabling the knockout and addition of specific DNA fragments. This technology has been widely used in various types of biomedical research, clinics and agriculture. In terms of disease research, constructing appropriate animal models is necessary. Combining reproductive technology with genome editing, many animal disease models have been generated for basic and clinical research. In addition, precisely targeted modifications allow genome editing to flourish in the field of gene therapy. Many mutations refractory to traditional gene therapy could be permanently corrected at the DNA level. Thus, genome editing is undoubtedly a promising technology for gene therapy.

Due to the current high engraftment rates, the low incidence of graft-vs.-host disease and regimen related mortality, transplantation from haploidentical donors have been progressively offered even to elderly patients.

Early detection of this condition speeds up the establishment of appropriate treatment and increases the patient's life expectancy. Newborn screening for SCID started in January 2017 in Catalonia, the first Spanish and European region to universally include this testing. The results obtained in the first 2 years of experience are evaluated here. All babies born between January 2017 and December 2018 were screened. TREC quantification in DBS (1.5 mm diameter) was performed with the Enlite Neonatal TREC kit from PerkinElmer (Turku, Finland).

The substantial risks and cost associated with this procedure render it unfeasible on a large scale. This strategy also indicates that a common pathway toward a cure for both HIV and cancer may exist. Successful approaches to curing both diseases should ideally possess three components, i.e., (1) direct targeting of pathological cells (neoplastic cells in cancer and the HIV-infected reservoir cells), (2) subsequent impediment to reconstitution of the pool of pathological cells and (3) sustained, immunologic control of the disease (both diseases are characterized by detrimental immune hyper-activation that hinders successful establishment of immunity). In this review, we explore medications that are either investigational or FDA-approved anticancer treatments that may be employed to achieve the goal of curing HIV-1.

In particular, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the fundamental energy currency of cellular activity and adenosine has been demonstrated to play essential roles in human physiology and pathophysiology. In this review, we examine the role of purinergic signaling in acute and chronic pulmonary inflammation, with emphasis on ATP and adenosine. ATP is released into extracellular space in response to cellular injury and necrosis. It is then metabolized to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) via ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39) and further hydrolyzed to adenosine via ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). Adenosine signals via one of four adenosine receptors to exert pro- or anti-inflammatory effects. Adenosine signaling is terminated by intracellular transport by concentrative or equilibrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs and ENTs), deamination to inosine by adenosine deaminase (ADA), or phosphorylation back into AMP via adenosine kinase (AK). Pulmonary inflammatory and hypoxic conditions lead to increased extracellular ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine levels, which translates to increased adenosine signaling. Adenosine signaling is central to the pulmonary injury response, leading to various effects on inflammation, repair and remodeling processes that are either tissue-protective or tissue destructive. In the acute setting, particularly through activation of adenosine 2A and 2B receptors, adenosine signaling serves an anti-inflammatory, tissue-protective role. However, excessive adenosine signaling in the chronic setting promotes pro-inflammatory, tissue destructive effects in chronic pulmonary inflammation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Thanh-Thuy T Le, Nathaniel K Berg, Matthew T Harting, Xiangyun Li, Holger K Eltzschig, Xiaoyi Yuan<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379836">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Graft Engineering and Adoptive Immunotherapy: New Approaches to Promote Immune Tolerance After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative therapeutic option for a wide range of immune and hematologic malignant and non-malignant disorders. Once transplanted, allogeneic cells have to support myeloid repopulation and immunological reconstitution, but also need to become tolerant to the host via central or peripheral mechanisms to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Peripheral tolerance after allogeneic HSCT may be achieved by several mechanisms, though blocking alloreactivity to the host human leukocyte antigens while preserving immune responses to pathogens and tumor antigens remains a challenge. Recently uncovered evidence on the mechanisms of post-HSCT immune reconstitution and tolerance in transplanted patients has allowed for the development of novel cell-based therapeutic approaches. These therapies are aimed at inducing long-term peripheral tolerance and reducing the risk of graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), while sparing the graft-vs-leukemia (GvL) effect. Thus, ensuring effective long term remission in hematologic malignancies. Today, haploidentical stem cell transplants have become a widely used treatment for patients with hematological malignancies.

Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-28<br><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Liu, Di He, Lei Xie<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS Comput.

These individuals, as well as two additional members of the same family also carrying this KLF1 mutation, exhibit high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). KLF1 is an erythroid transcription factor, which plays a critical role in the regulation of the developmental switch between fetal and adult hemoglobin by regulating the expression of a multitude of genes including that of BCL11A. The mutation appears to be the main candidate responsible for the beta thalassemia-ameliorating effect as this segregates with the observed phenotype and also exogenous expression of the KLF1 mutant protein in human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in the induction of γ-globin, without, however, affecting BCL11A levels.

However, the pathophysiological roles of recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), one of the receptor tyrosine kinases, have not yet been defined. We investigated whether the activation or sequence-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppression of RON could regulate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the expression of pro-fibrotic markers, and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Stable cell lines and transient transfection for RON and the transfected cells of siRNA for RON were developed to investigate the molecular mechanisms in human kidney proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) and interstitial fibroblasts (NRK49F) cells. RON overexpression induced EMT and increased expression of fibrosis-related proteins such as N-cadherin, vimentin, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), αSMA, and fibronectin in HK-2 and NRK49F cells. RON overexpression increased various RTKs and the phosphorylation of Src (Y416) and Smad, while inhibition of RON by siRNA attenuated the expression of EMT- and fibrosis-related proteins and decreased RTKs such as insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), as well as the phosphorylation of Src and Smad pathways. siRNA silencing of Src also attenuated the expression of IGFR, FGFR1, VEGFR, and PDGFR.

Therefore, we compared the profile of microRNA expression in iPSC lines and in NSC lines derived from them, using microarray-based analysis. Two different protocols for NSC formation were used: Direct and two-step via neural rosette formation. We confirmed the new associations of previously described miRNAs in regulation of NSC differentiation from iPSC. We discovered upregulation of miR-10 family, miR-30 family and miR-9 family and downregulation of miR-302 and miR-515 family expression. Moreover, we showed that miR-10 family play a crucial role in the negative regulation of genes expression belonging to signaling pathways involved in neural differentiation: WNT signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Katarzyna Kulcenty, Joanna P Wroblewska, Marcin Rucinski, Emilia Kozlowska, Karol Jopek, Wiktoria M Suchorska<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357387">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Derived Polymorphic Amplified Cleaved Sequence (dPACS): A Novel PCR-RFLP Procedure for Detecting Known Single Nucleotide and Deletion-Insertion Polymorphisms.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Most methods developed for detecting known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and deletion-insertion polymorphisms (DIP) are dependent on sequence conservation around the SNP/DIP and are therefore not suitable for application to heterogeneous organisms.

EVs can be released by every cell type and they can be classified into three major groups according to their biogenesis, dimension, density, and predominant protein markers: exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. During their formation, EVs associate with specific cargo from their parental cell that can include RNAs, free fatty acids, surface receptors, and proteins. The biological function of EVs is to maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis by transferring critical biological cargos to distal or neighboring recipient cells. On the other hand, their role in intercellular communication may also contribute to the pathogenesis of several diseases, including thrombosis. More recently, their physiological and biochemical properties have suggested their use as a therapeutic tool in tissue regeneration as well as a novel option for drug delivery.

However, CRISPR/Cas-based strategies designed to precisely edit the genome can often yield unintended outcomes. Here, we report the use of zygotic CRISPR/Cas9 injections to generate a knock-in GFP reporter mouse at the Gdf11 locus. Phenotypic and genomic characterization of founder animals from these injections revealed a subset that contained the correct targeting event and exhibited GFP expression that, within the hematopoietic system, was restricted predominantly to lymphoid cells. Yet, in another subset of founder mice, we detected aberrant integration events at the target site that dramatically and inaccurately shifted hematopoietic GFP expression from the lymphoid to the myeloid lineage. Additionally, we recovered multiple Gdf11 deletion alleles that modified the C-terminus of the GDF11 protein. When bred to homozygosity, most of these alleles recapitulated skeletal phenotypes reported previously for Gdf11 knockout mice, suggesting that these represent null alleles. However, we also recovered one Gdf11 deletion allele that encodes a novel GDF11 variant protein ("GDF11-WE") predicted to contain two additional amino acids (tryptophan (W) and glutamic acid (E)) at the C-terminus of the mature ligand.

CRISPR/Cas9 has been rapidly applied to basic research as well as expanded for potential clinical applications. Utilization of spCas9 as an ribonuclearprotein complex (RNP) is considered the most safe and effective method to apply Cas9 technology, and the efficacy of this system is critically dependent on the ability of Cas9 to generate high levels of indels. We find here that novel sequence changes to the tracrRNA significantly improves Cas9 activity when delivered as an RNP. We demonstrate that a dual-guide RNA (dgRNA) with a modified tracrRNA can improve reporter knockdown and indel formation at several targets within the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV. Furthermore, the sequence-modified tracrRNAs improved Cas9-mediated reduction of CCR5 surface receptor expression in cell lines, which correlated with higher levels of indel formation. It was demonstrated that a Cas9 RNP with a sequence modified tracrRNA enhanced indel formation at the CCR5 target site in primary CD4+ T-cells. Finally, we show improved activity at two additional targets within the HBB locus and the BCL11A GATA site. Overall, the data presented here suggests that novel facile tracrRNA sequence changes could potentially be integrated with current dgRNA technology, and open up the possibility for the development of sequence modified tracrRNAs to improve Cas9 RNP activity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Tristan Scott, Ryan Urak, Citradewi Soemardy, Kevin V Morris<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695072">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A Microfluidic Device to Enhance Viral Transduction Efficiency During Manufacture of Engineered Cellular Therapies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The development and approval of engineered cellular therapies are revolutionizing approaches to treatment of diseases.

Integration of new genetic material into the target cells, such as viral transduction, is one of the most costly and labor-intensive steps in the production of cellular therapies. Approaches to reducing the costs associated with gene delivery have been developed using microfluidic devices to increase overall efficiency.

A humanised mouse model of β-thalassemia was used, in which heterozygous animals are anaemic with splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Intrahepatic in utero injections of a β globin-expressing lentiviral vector (GLOBE), were performed in fetuses at E13.5 of gestation. We analysed animals at 12 and 32 weeks of age, for vector copy number in bone marrow, peripheral blood liver and spleen and we performed integration site analysis. Compared to noninjected heterozygous animals IUGT normalised blood haemoglobin levels and spleen weight. Integration site analysis showed polyclonality. The left ventricular ejection fraction measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in treated heterozygous animals was similar to that of normal non-β-thalassemic mice but significantly higher than untreated heterozygous thalassemia mice suggesting that IUGT ameliorated poor cardiac function. GLOBE LV-mediated IUGT normalised the haematological and anatomical phenotype in a heterozygous humanised model of β-thalassemia.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Panicos Shangaris, Stavros P Loukogeorgakis, Sindhu Subramaniam, Christina Flouri, Laurence H Jackson, Wei Wang, Michael P Blundell, Shanrun Liu, Simon Eaton, Nahla Bakhamis, Durrgah Latchumi Ramachandra, Panayiotis Maghsoudlou, Luca Urbani, Simon N Waddington, Ayad Eddaoudi, Joy Archer, Michael N Antoniou, Daniel J Stuckey, Manfred Schmidt, Adrian J Thrasher, Thomas M Ryan, Paolo De Coppi, Anna L David<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406195">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Heme Catabolic Pathway in Inflammation and Immune Disorders.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, the heme catabolic pathway is considered to play an important regulatory role in cell protection, apoptosis, inflammation, and other physiological and pathological processes. An appropriate amount of heme forms the basic elements of various life activities, while when released in large quantities, it can induce toxicity by mediating oxidative stress and inflammation. Heme oxygenase (HO) -1 can catabolize free heme into carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron, and biliverdin (BV)/bilirubin (BR). The diverse functions of these metabolites in immune systems are fascinating. Decades work shows that administration of degradation products of heme such as CO and BV/BR exerts protective activities in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS) and other immune disorders. This review elaborates the molecular and biochemical characterization of heme catabolic pathway, discusses the signal transduction and immunomodulatory mechanism in inflammation and summarizes the promising therapeutic strategies based on this pathway in inflammatory and immune disorders.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Bing Wu, Yanwei Wu, Wei Tang<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Pharmacol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1663-9812<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.86<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.256<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396090">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Ironing out Macrophage Immunometabolism.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Over the last decade, increasing evidence has reinforced the key role of metabolic reprogramming in macrophage activation. In addition to supporting the specific immune response of different subsets of macrophages, intracellular metabolic pathways also directly control the specialized effector functions of immune cells. In this context, iron metabolism has been recognized as an important component of macrophage plasticity. Since macrophages control the availability of this essential metal, changes in the expression of genes coding for the major proteins of iron metabolism may result in different iron availability for the macrophage itself and for other cells in the microenvironment.

Translational medical efforts are likewise rapidly progressing, and Phase I clinical trials using these techniques have already started. As with any new technology that is applied to medical therapeutics, risks must be carefully defined and steps taken to mitigate side effects wherever possible. Effective methods are now available that permit identification of off-target cleavage events, a major class of potential side effects seen in mammalian genome editing. Off-target prediction algorithms are improving and have utility, but are insufficient to use alone. Empiric methods to define the off-target profile must also be used. Once defined, the frequency of off-target cleavage can be minimized using methods that limit the duration of exposure of the genome to the active genome editing complex, for example, using the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) approach. In addition, Cas9 mutants have been developed that markedly reduce the rate of off-target cleavage compared to the wild-type enzyme.

Intra-vascular hemolysis illustrates well the multiple-hit theory where a first event lyses red blood cells, releasing hemolysis-derived products, in particular cell-free heme which is highly toxic for the endothelium. Physiologically, hemolysis derived-products are rapidly neutralized by numerous defense systems, including haptoglobin and hemopexin which scavenge hemoglobin and heme, respectively. Likewise, cellular defense mechanisms are involved, including heme-oxygenase 1 upregulation which metabolizes heme. However, in cases of intra-vascular hemolysis, those systems are overwhelmed. Heme exerts toxic effects by acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern and promoting, together with hemoglobin, nitric oxide scavenging and ROS production. In addition, it activates the complement and the coagulation systems. Together, these processes lead to endothelial cell injury which triggers pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory phenotypes. Moreover, among endothelial cells, glomerular ones display a particular susceptibility explained by a weaker capacity to counteract hemolysis injury. In this review, we illustrate the 'multiple-hit' theory through the example of intra-vascular hemolysis, with a particular focus on cell-free heme, and we advance hypotheses explaining the glomerular susceptibility observed in hemolytic diseases. Finally, we describe therapeutic options for reducing endothelial injury in hemolytic diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Marie Frimat, Idris Boudhabhay, Lubka T Roumenina<br><b>Journal:</b> Toxins (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6651<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.76<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.029<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766155">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The work, goals, challenges, achievements, and recommendations of orphan medicinal product organizations in India: an interview-based study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Orphan medicinal products (OMPs) are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, management or treatment of rare diseases (RDs). Each RD affects only a small fraction of the population, and therefore, historically, industry hesitated to undertake relevant research and development (R&D). In response, the governments of many countries came up with orphan drug policies and RD policies which were hugely successful in incentivizing companies to do so. In India, in the absence of any such policy until recently, there are very few organizations involved in RD R&D.
OBJECTIVES: We wished to understand (i) the OMP Organizations' (OMPOs') areas of work and the nature of their work, (ii) their goals, (iii) the challenges they faced and how they were overcoming them, (iv) their achievements, and (v) their recommendations to the government to help their R&D, their success as commercial entities (where applicable), and patients' access to their products or services.
RESULTS: Ten of the 14 OMPOs are companies, whereas four are not-for-profit organizations. Almost all of the OMPOs are heavily into R&D. Six have already made their products or services available to patients. Four plan to out-license their products after the pre-clinical phase or phase 1 trials, eight plan to cater to patients directly and two of the OMPOs have been established only recently and thus do not yet have any product or service to offer patients. Nine OMPOs import about 90% of the components in the production process, which comprises either capital or recurrent expenditure. For most, locally manufactured alternatives are not available or are of inadequate quality. Most of the OMPOs have had productive collaborations with local or foreign academics or hospitals for R&D, animal efficacy studies, clinical trials or providing services to patients. The main challenges for the OMPOs are the lack of adequate funding, supportive government policies, and a conducive ecosystem.
CONCLUSIONS: These OMPOs are pioneers in their respective fields in India, and despite the challenges, have achieved new levels of innovation. With suitable government policies, they could scale up and provide relevant products and services to the large number of RD patients in the country whose medical needs are largely unmet.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Mohua Chakraborty Choudhury, Gayatri Saberwal<br><b>Journal:</b> Orphanet J Rare Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1750-1172<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.589<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684990">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gene Therapy For Beta-Thalassemia: Updated Perspectives.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was until very recently, the only permanent curative option available for patients suffering from transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Gene therapy, by autologous transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells, currently represents a novel therapeutic promise, after many years of extensive preclinical research for the optimization of gene transfer protocols. Nowadays, clinical trials being held on a worldwide setting, have demonstrated that, by re-establishing effective hemoglobin production, patients may be rendered transfusion- and chelation-independent and evade the immunological complications that normally accompany allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The present review will offer a retrospective scope of the long way paved towards successful implementation of gene therapy for beta-thalassemia, and will pinpoint the latest strategies employed to increase globin expression that extend beyond the classic transgene addition perspective. A thorough search was performed using Pubmed in order to identify studies that provide a proof of principle on the aforementioned topic at a preclinical and clinical level. Inclusion criteria also regarded gene transfer technologies of the past two decades, as well as publications outlining the pitfalls that precluded earlier successful implementation of gene therapy for beta-thalassemia. Overall, after decades of research, that included both successes and pitfalls, the path towards a permanent, donor-irrespective cure for beta-thalassemia patients is steadily becoming a realistic approach.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-02<br><b>Authors:</b> Garyfalia Karponi, Nikolaos Zogas<br><b>Journal:</b> Appl Clin Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-704X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.67<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.745<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576160">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Low-Dose Busulfan Reduces Human CD34<br><b>Abstract:</b> Humanized animal models are central to efforts aimed at improving hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation with or without genetic modification.

Most of them are characterized by a progressive damage of muscle fibers with reduced muscle strength, disability, and poor health-related quality of life of affected patients. In this scenario, skeletal health is usually compromised as a consequence of modified bone-muscle cross-talk including biomechanical and bio-humoral issues, resulting in increased risk of bone fragility and fractures. In addition, NMD patients frequently face nutritional issues, including malnutrition due to feeding disorders and swallowing problems that might affect bone health. Moreover, in these patients, low levels of physical activity or immobility are common and might lead to overweight or obesity that can also interfere with bone strength features. Also, vitamin D deficiency could play a critical role both in the pathogenesis and in the clinical scenario of many NMDs, suggesting that its correction could be useful in maintaining or enhancing bone health, especially in the early phases of NMDs. Last but not least, specific disease-modifying drugs, available for some NMDs, are frequently burdened with adverse effects on bone tissue. For example, glucocorticoid therapy, standard of care for many muscular dystrophies, prolongs long-term survival in treated patients; nevertheless, high dose and/or chronic use of these drugs are a common cause of secondary osteoporosis. This review addresses the current state of knowledge about the factors that play a role in determining bone alterations reported in NMDs, how these factors can modify the biological pathways underlying bone health, and which are the available interventions to manage bone involvement in patients affected by NMDs. Considering the complexity of care of these patients, an interdisciplinary and multimodal management strategy based on both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is recommended, particularly targeting musculoskeletal issues that are closely related to functional independence as well as social implications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Iolascon, Marco Paoletta, Sara Liguori, Claudio Curci, Antimo Moretti<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-2392<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.63<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.344<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31824418">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gender-Related Differences in Sickle Cell Disease in a Pediatric Cohort: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disease worldwide.

Individuals with a homozygous CCR5Δ32 mutation have a long lasting and increased resistance to HIV-1 infection. Therefore, CCR5 represents an optimal target for HIV-1/AIDS gene therapy. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been developed as one of the most efficacious gene editing tools in mammalian cells and the small-sized version from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) has an advantage of easier delivery compared to the most commonly used version from Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9).
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that CCR5 could be specifically and efficiently edited by CRISPR/SaCas9 together with two sgRNAs, which were identified through a screening of 13 sgRNAs.

Although described more than a century ago, challenges in comprehensive disease management and collaborative research on this disease are compounded by the complex molecular and clinical phenotypes of SCD, environmental and psychosocial factors, limited therapeutic options and ambiguous terminology. This ambiguous terminology has hampered the integration and interoperability of existing SCD knowledge, and SCD research translation. The SCD Ontology (SCDO), which is a community-driven integrative and universal knowledge representation system for SCD, overcomes this issue by providing a controlled vocabulary developed by a group of experts in both SCD and ontology design. SCDO is the first and most comprehensive standardized human- and machine-readable resource that unambiguously represents terminology and concepts about SCD for researchers, patients and clinicians. It is built around the central concept 'hemoglobinopathy', allowing inclusion of non-SCD haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassaemias, which may interfere with or influence SCD phenotypic manifestations. This collaboratively developed ontology constitutes a comprehensive knowledge management system and standardized terminology of various SCD-related factors. The SCDO will promote interoperability of different research datasets, facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations, including meta-analyses within the SCD community, and support the development and curation of data-basing and clinical informatics in SCD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> None None<br><b>Journal:</b> Database (Oxford)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1758-0463<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.42<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.016<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31769834">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Development and Clinical Translation of Approved Gene Therapy Products for Genetic Disorders.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The field of gene therapy is striving more than ever to define a path to the clinic and the market.

We investigated the selective killing efficacy of a lentivirus-mediated cytosine deaminase-thymidine kinase (CDglyTK) gene in transplanted breast cancer delivered into a free flap by intra-artery perfusion.
METHODS: Proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of rat SHZ-88 breast cancer cells transfected with a lentivirus-mediated CD/TK gene were measured following treatment with ganciclovir and 5-flucytosine in vitro. A model of residual disease of breast cancer in a rat superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) flap model was used to study the therapeutic potential of a double suicide CD/TK and prodrug system in vivo.
RESULTS: Killing efficacy of the double suicide CD/TK and prodrug system on SHZ-88 cells was mediated by increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase with significant bystander effect. Following recombinant lentivirus transfection of rat SIEA flap by intra-artery perfusion, CD/TK gene expression was limited to the flap, and the volume and weight of transplanted tumors were significantly reduced without observable toxicity.

These assays are easy to perform and used in large-scale newborn screening in many countries. These tests however may not easily differentiate Sβ0 thalassemia from SS or identify other hemoglobin variants, and in this case, hemoglobin (HBB) gene sequencing may be necessary.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a high throughput DNA based confirmatory assay for SCD and to detect mutations in the HBB gene.
METHODS: We developed an automated pyrosequencing technique (PyS) based on QIAGEN technology (Hilden, Germany) to detect homozygous or heterozygous hemoglobin S mutations as well as hemoglobin C mutations. The technique was tested on 2,748 samples from patients enrolled in a multi-center SCD cohort in Brazil. Patients were previously tested using HPLC to diagnose SCD as part of routine clinical care. Any subjects with discrepant results between HPLC and PyS or with heterozygous hemoglobin S detected had Sanger sequencing of the HBB gene.
RESULTS: We identified 168 samples with discrepant results between HPLC and PyS and 100 with concordant PyS = heterozygous S and HPLC, which would suggest SB-thalassemia or other heterozygous S variants. The PyS assay correctly identified 1906 (98.7%) of the 1930 HbSS and 628 (98.7%) of the 636 HbSC samples. Of the 179 remaining samples, PyS correctly indicated S heterozygosis in 165 (92.2%). Of the 165 heterozygous S samples confirmed by Sanger as consistent with Sβ thalassemia genotype, 84 samples were classified as Sβ0 thalassemia and 81 as Sβ+ thalassemia. The most frequent beta thalassemia mutations of Sβ0 and Sβ+ were HBB: c.118C>T (Gln40Stop) and HBB c.92 + 6T> C, respectively.
DISCUSSION: The PyS proved to be satisfactory for large-scale confirmatory testing of hemoglobin mutation. Moreover, with this study we were able to describe the most common β+ and β0 mutations in SCD patients with Sβ-thalassemia in a large multi-institutional SCD cohort in Brazil.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Camila Cruz de Martino, Cecilia Salete Alencar, Paula Loureiro, Anna Barbara de Freitas Carneiro-Proietti, Claudia de Alvarenga Máximo, Rosimere Afonso Mota, Daniela Oliveira Werneck Rodrigues, Nelson Gaburo Junior, Shannon Kelly, Ester Cerdeira Sabino, None None<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830127">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gene editing of PKLR gene in human hematopoietic progenitors through 5' and 3' UTR modified TALEN mRNA.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD) is a rare erythroid metabolic disease caused by mutations in the PKLR gene, which encodes the erythroid specific Pyruvate Kinase enzyme. Erythrocytes from PKD patients show an energetic imbalance and are susceptible to hemolysis. Gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would provide a therapeutic benefit and improve safety of gene therapy approaches to treat PKD patients. In previous studies, we established a gene editing protocol that corrected the PKD phenotype of PKD-iPSC lines through a TALEN mediated homologous recombination strategy. With the goal of moving toward more clinically relevant stem cells, we aim at editing the PKLR gene in primary human hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HPSCs). After nucleofection of the gene editing tools and selection with puromycin, up to 96% colony forming units showed precise integration. However, a low yield of gene edited HPSCs was associated to the procedure. To reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy, we worked on i) optimizing gene editing tools and ii) defining optimal expansion and selection times. Different versions of specific nucleases (TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9) were compared. TALEN mRNAs with 5' and 3' added motifs to increase RNA stability were the most efficient nucleases to obtain high gene editing frequency and low toxicity. Shortening ex vivo manipulation did not reduce the efficiency of homologous recombination and preserved the hematopoietic progenitor potential of the nucleofected HPSCs. Lastly, a very low level of gene edited HPSCs were detected after engraftment in immunodeficient (NSG) mice. Overall, we showed that gene editing of the PKLR gene in HPSCs is feasible, although further improvements must to be done before the clinical use of the gene editing to correct PKD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Quintana-Bustamante, Sara Fañanas-Baquero, Israel Orman, Raul Torres, Philippe Duchateau, Laurent Poirot, Agnès Gouble, Juan A Bueren, Jose C Segovia<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618280">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> CRISPR/Cas9 gene correction of HbH-CS thalassemia-induced pluripotent stem cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Haemoglobin (Hb) H-constant spring (CS) alpha thalassaemia (- -/-α<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Xie Yingjun, Xie Yuhuan, Chen Yuchang, Li Dongzhi, Wang Ding, Song Bing, Yang Yi, Lu Dian, Xue Yanting, Xiong Zeyu, Liu Nengqing, Chen Diyu, Sun Xiaofang<br><b>Journal:</b> Ann.

CRISPR/Cas9-guide RNA complexes enable rapid and efficient genome editing in mammalian cells. This system induces double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) at target sites and most DNA breakages induce mutations as small insertions or deletions (indels) by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. However, for more precise correction as knock-in or replacement of DNA base pairs, using the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway is essential. Until now, many trials have greatly enhanced knock-in or substitution efficiency by increasing HDR efficiency, or newly developed methods such as Base Editors (BEs). However, accuracy remains unsatisfactory. In this review, we summarize studies to overcome the limitations of HDR using the CRISPR system and discuss future direction.

Here, we review mechanistic pathways for which there is accumulating evidence and propose an integrative systems-biology framework for understanding neurological risk. Drawing upon work from other vascular beds in SCD, as well as the wider stroke literature, we propose that macro-circulatory hyper-perfusion, regions of relative micro-circulatory hypo-perfusion, and an exhaustion of cerebral reserve mechanisms, together lead to a state of cerebral vascular instability. We suggest that in this state, tissue oxygen supply is fragile and easily perturbed by changes in clinical condition, with the potential for stroke and/or microstructural injury if metabolic demand exceeds tissue oxygenation.

Currently, the only FDA approved treatment for ischemic stroke is the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Stem cell clinical trials for stroke have been underway for close to two decades, with data suggesting that cell therapies are safe, feasible, and potentially efficacious. However, clinical trials for stroke account for <1% of all stem cell trials. Nevertheless, the resources devoted to clinical research to identify new treatments for stroke is still significant (53-64 million US$, Phase 1-4). Notably, a quarter of cell therapy clinical trials for stroke have been withdrawn (15.2%) or terminated (6.8%) to date. This review discusses the bottlenecks in delivering a successful cell therapy for stroke, and the cost-to-benefit ratio necessary to justify these expensive trials. Further, this review will critically assess the currently available data from completed stroke trials, the importance of standardization in outcome reporting, and the role of industry-led research in the development of cell therapies for stroke.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Mirja Krause, Thanh G Phan, Henry Ma, Christopher G Sobey, Rebecca Lim<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Neurol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-2295<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.75<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.185<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293500">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> BCL11A: a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in human diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) gene encodes a zinc-finger protein that is predominantly expressed in brain and hematopoietic tissue.

The clinical management has improved considerably during recent years; however, minimal attempts are made to up lift the quality of life among patients, especially in developing countries. Here we aim to describe and compare and to determine factors associated with health related quality of life among patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E β-thalassemia in Sri Lanka.
METHODS: A case control study was conducted in the three largest thalassaemia centres of Sri Lanka. All patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia (β-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia) aged 5-18 years were recruited as cases whilst a randomly selected group of children without chronic diseases were recruited as controls. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and health related quality of life was measured using the validated Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy one patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia (male-49.1%; mean age- 10.9 ± 3.6 years) and 254 controls (male-47.2%; mean age- 10.4 ± 3.5 years) were recruited. Mean health-related quality of life scores were significantly lower in patients compared to controls (72.9 vs. 91.5, p < 0.001). Of the patients, 224 (84%) had β-thalassaemia major and 43 (16%) had haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia. Quality of life scores in psychological health (p < 0.05), emotional functioning (p < 0.05) and social functioning (p < 0.05) were significantly lower in patients with haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia compared to β-thalassaemia major. Splenectomy (p < 0.05), short stature (p < 0.05), under nutrition (p < 0.05) and longer hospital stays (p < 0.05) were significantly associated with lower quality of life scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in management, the quality of life among patients with β-thalassaemia still remains low. This is more pronounced in the subset of patients with haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia. Splenectomy, short stature, undernutrition and longer hospital stays were significantly associated with poor quality of life. It is timely, even in developing countries, to direct emphasis and to take appropriate steps to improve standards of living and quality of life of patients with β-thalassaemia.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Sachith Mettananda, Hashan Pathiraja, Ravindu Peiris, Dayananda Bandara, Udaya de Silva, Chamila Mettananda, Anuja Premawardhena<br><b>Journal:</b> Health Qual Life Outcomes<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1477-7525<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.42<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.083<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395066">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MAT2B expression correlates with poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Jin Xu, Di Wu, Siliang Wang, Zhe Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancer Manag Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1179-1322<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.25<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.892<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354356">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Era of Genomic Medicine: A Narrative Review on CRISPR Technology as a Potential Therapeutic Tool for Human Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) provides acquired immunity in microorganisms against exogenous DNA that may hinder the survival of the organism. Pioneering work by Doudna and Charpentier in 2012 resulted in the creation of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool on the basis of this concept. The aim of this was to create a rapid, efficient, and versatile genome-editing tool to facilitate genetic manipulation. The mechanism relies on two components: the RNA guide which acts as a sentinel and a Cas protein complex which functions as a highly precise molecular knife. The guide RNA can be modified to match a DNA sequence of interest in the cell and accordingly be used to rectify mutations that may otherwise cause disease. Within a few years following the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, its usage has become ubiquitous. Its influence extends into many fields of biological sciences from biotechnology and biochemistry to molecular biology and biomedical sciences.

Not only does it affect ruminant animal populations, leading to a substantial financial burden for stockbreeders, but also poses severe public health issues. For almost four decades in southern Europe and elsewhere, eradication of the disease has been based on ambiguously effective programs, rendering massive sanitation of livestock urgent and indispensable. Gene therapy, which has been proved effective in the clinic, could possibly constitute an alternative option towards a permanent cure for brucellosis, by aiding in the deletion or inactivation of genes associated with the replication of Brucella within the host cells.
RESULTS: We infected ovine macrophages with B.melitensis, to simulate the host cell/microorganism interaction in vitro, and transduced the infected cells with CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors that target Brucella's RNA polymerase subunit A (RpolA) or virulence-associated gene virB10 at a multiplicity of infection of 60. We demonstrate a significant decrease in the bacterial load per cell when infected cells are transduced with the RpolA vector and that the number of internalized brucellae per cell remains unaffected when macrophages are transduced with a conventional lentiviral vector expressing the green fluorescence protein, thus underlining the bactericidal effect of our CRISPR/Cas9 system.

Southeast China is a highly infected area affected by four β-thalassemia mutation types (HBB:c.-78A>G, HBB:c.52A>T, HBB:c.126_129delCTTT, and HBB:c.316-197C>T). Relative haplotype dosage (RHDO), a haplotype-based approach, has shown promise as an application for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD); however, additional family members (such as the proband) are required for haplotype construction. The abovementioned circumstances make RHDO-based NIPD cost prohibitive; additionally, the genetic information of the proband is not always available. Thus, it is necessary to find a practical method to solve these problems.
METHODS: Targeted sequencing was applied to sequence parental genomic DNA and cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA). Parental haplotypes were constructed with the SHAPEIT software based on the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) Phase 3 v5 Southern Han Chinese (CHS) haplotype dataset. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the target region were called and classified, and the fetal mutation inheritance status was deduced using the RHDO method.
RESULTS: Construction of the parental haplotypes and detection of the inherited parental mutations were successfully achieved in five families, despite a suspected recombination event. The status of the affected fetuses is consistent with the results of traditional reverse dot blot (RDB) diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: This research introduced SHAPEIT into the classical RHDO workflow and proved that it is applicable to construct parental haplotypes without information from other family members.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Haoxian Li, Bole Du, Fuman Jiang, Yulai Guo, Yang Wang, Chunsheng Zhang, Xiaojing Zeng, Yuhuan Xie, Shuming Ouyang, Yexing Xian, Min Chen, Weiqiang Liu, Xiaofang Sun<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Genet Genomic Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2324-9269<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.806<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566929">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Curing Hemoglobinopathies: Challenges and Advances of Conventional and New Gene Therapy Approaches.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Inherited hemoglobin disorders, including beta-thalassemia (BT) and sickle-cell disease (SCD), are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, with a global carrier frequency of over 5%.1 With migration, they are becoming more common worldwide, making their management and care an increasing concern for health care systems. BT is characterized by an imbalance in the α/β-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolytic anemia, and compensatory hemopoietic expansion.1 Globally, there are over 25,000 births each year with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). The currently available treatment for TDT is lifelong transfusions and iron chelation therapy or allogenic bone marrow transplantation as a curative option. SCD affects 300 million people worldwide2 and severely impacts the quality of life of patients who experience unpredictable, recurrent acute and chronic severe pain, stroke, infections, pulmonary disease, kidney disease, retinopathy, and other complications. While survival has been dramatically extended, quality of life is markedly reduced by disease- and treatment-associated morbidity. The development of safe, tissue-specific and efficient vectors, and efficient gene-editing technologies have led to the development of several gene therapy trials for BT and SCD. However, the complexity of the approach presents its hurdles. Fundamental factors at play include the requirement for myeloablation on a patient with benign disease, the age of the patient, and the consequent bone marrow microenvironment. A successful path from proof-ofconcept studies to commercialization must render gene therapy a sustainable and accessible approach for a large number of patients. Furthermore, the cost of these therapies is a considerable challenge for the health care system. While new promising therapeutic options are emerging,3,4 and many others are on the pipeline,5 gene therapy can potentially cure patients.

BCL11A is a master regulator of γ-globin gene silencing, and suppresses fetal hemoglobin expression by association with other γ-globin suppressors, and also interacts with human beta-globin locus control region as well as intergenic region between the Aγ and δ-globin genes to reconfigure beta-globin cluster. Thus, HbF reactivation has been proposed to be an approach for the treatment of β-thalassemia through knockout of BCL11A. Accordingly, an erythroid enhancer sequence was identified that, when inactivated, led to repression of BCL11A and induction of γ-globin in the erythroid lineage [2-7]. This article describes data that obtained from BCL11A gene enhancer modification in KU812 and KG-1 cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in order to reactivate γ-globin gene expression.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-31<br><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Ali Khosravi, Maryam Abbasalipour, Jean-Paul Concordet, Johannes Vom Berg, Sirous Zeinali, Arash Arashkia, Thorsten Buch, Morteza Karimipoor<br><b>Journal:</b> Data Brief<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2352-3409<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.97<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.366<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31890812">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Moving Beyond 'Therapy' and 'Enhancement' in the Ethics of Gene Editing.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Since the advent of recombinant DNA technology, expectations (and trepidations) about the potential for altering genes and controlling our biology at the fundamental level have been sky high. These expectations have gone largely unfulfilled. But though the dream (or nightmare) of being able to control our biology is still far off, gene editing research has made enormous strides toward potential clinical use. This paper argues that when it comes to determining permissible uses of gene editing in one important medical context-germline intervention in reproductive medicine-issues about enhancement and eugenics are, for the foreseeable future, a red herring. Current translational goals for gene editing research involve a different kind of editing than would be required to achieve manipulation of complex traits such as intelligence, and there are more pressing (and unresolved) questions that need attention if clinical use of gene editing in reproductive medicine ever becomes a possibility.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Cwik<br><b>Journal:</b> Camb Q Healthc Ethics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1469-2147<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.94<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.520<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526421">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Diamond-Blackfan anemia RPL35A: a case report.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare congenital red blood cell aplasia characterized by failed erythropoiesis, congenital abnormalities in up to 50% of patients, growth retardation in up to 30% of patients, and a predisposition to malignancy. Diamond-Blackfan anemia is both clinically and genetically a heterogenous condition ranging from subtle asymptomatic erythroid abnormalities to non-immune hydrops fetalis. Current treatment options include corticosteroid therapy, chronic red blood cell transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with gene therapy receiving recent attention. We report the first documented case of Diamond-Blackfan anemia in a Caucasian girl secondary to a sporadic heterozygous whole gene deletion in RPL35A in South Africa. Limited resources, non-availability of tests, unfamiliarity that comes with rare diseases, an expanded differential diagnosis, and an associated neutropenia led to a delay in the diagnosis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. This case reminds clinicians of Diamond-Blackfan anemia as a cause of aplastic anemia and highlights the difficulty and obstacles in diagnosing Diamond-Blackfan anemia in resource-limited countries.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 6-week-old Caucasian girl presenting with urosepsis and heart failure secondary to a severe anemia and neutropenia. Limited experience and resources resulted in a delay in diagnosis. Genetic studies later confirmed a heterozygous whole gene deletion of RPL35A. Initial treatment was directed toward correcting the anemia with red blood cell transfusion every 3 to 5 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed early and managed appropriately. Limited health resources, patient registries, and specialists as seen in developing countries result in a paucity of knowledge about Diamond-Blackfan anemia in Africa. This case reminds clinicians about Diamond-Blackfan anemia as a cause for anemia in infants, the limitations in making the diagnosis in under-resourced health care systems, and the need for standardized treatment protocols applicable to resource-limited countries.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Colin Byron Noel<br><b>Journal:</b> J Med Case Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1752-1947<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.62<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.262<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208452">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Vectofusin-1 Improves Transduction of Primary Human Cells with Diverse Retroviral and Lentiviral Pseudotypes, Enabling Robust, Automated Closed-System Manufacturing.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cell and gene therapies are finally becoming viable patient treatment options, with both T cell- and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based therapies being approved to market in Europe.

Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in three different thalassemia centers located in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from January to July 2019. These centers provide screened blood and essential medical care for thalassemia patients. These centers include the Fatimid Foundation, Hamza Foundation, and Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A total of 431 blood transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia patients registered at these centers were selected. QoL in β-TM patients was assessed by a newly developed instrument, the TranQoL questionnaire. For the data analysis procedure, Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences; version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used. Results A total of 431 patients were included in our study. The ages ranged from five years to 23 years with a mean age of 11.54 ± 3.6 years; 58.93% were male and the rest were female with a male to female ratio of 1.43:1. A total of 129 (29.93%) patients were infected by transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was found prevalent in 23.66%, hepatitis B virus (HBV) was found in 4.87%, and HIV was found prevalent in 1.39% cases. The results showed a high proportion of HCV in males 27.95% as compared to females 17.51% (p value = 0.31). Patients were divided into high (good) QoL score of >50 and low (poor) score of <50. In patients with hepatitis C, the QoL was poor in 90 (88.23%) patients and was good in only 12 (11.76%) patients (p value=0.01); in the hepatitis B group, it was good in only eight (38.09%) and poor in 13 (61.90%) patients (p-value 0.04), and for patients with HIV, it was poor in all six patients (p=0.001). Conclusion Our study concludes that transfusion-transmitted disease is very high and that HCV is the leading TTI followed by HBV and HIV. QoL in patients with TTIs was poor. The use of advanced technology in blood screening, voluntary donations, donor selection, and asepsis during blood transfusion is imperative to curtail the transmission.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-30<br><b>Authors:</b> May Al-Moshary, Eman Al-Mussaed, Adnan Khan<br><b>Journal:</b> Cureus<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2168-8184<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31886066">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Perspectives of Sickle Cell Disease Stakeholders on Heritable Genome Editing.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in CRISPR technology and the announcement of the first gene-edited babies have sparked a global dialogue about the future of heritable genome editing (HGE). There has been an international call for public input to inform a substantive debate about benefits and risks of HGE. This study investigates the views of the sickle cell disease (SCD) community. We utilized a mixed-methods approach to examine SCD stakeholders' views in the United States. We found SCD stakeholders hold a nuanced view of HGE. Assuming the technology is shown to be safe and effective, they are just as supportive of HGE as genetics professionals, but more supportive than the general public. However, they are also concerned about the potential implications of HGE, despite this support. As discourse surrounding HGE advances, it is crucial to engage disease communities and other key stakeholders whose lives could be altered by these interventions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Brittany M Hollister, Mariclare C Gatter, Khadijah E Abdallah, Alyssa J Armsby, Ashley J Buscetta, Yen Ji Julia Byeon, Kayla E Cooper, Stacy Desine, Anitra Persaud, Kelly E Ormond, Vence L Bonham<br><b>Journal:</b> CRISPR J<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2573-1602<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31742431">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> 75th Congress of the Italian Society of Pediatrics : Bologna, Italy. 29 May - 1 June 2019.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> <br><b>Journal:</b> Ital J Pediatr<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1824-7288<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849329">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genome editing of HBG1 and HBG2 to induce fetal hemoglobin.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9-mediated disruption of DNA regulatory elements that repress γ-globin gene (HBG1 and HBG2) expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia, although the optimal technical approaches and limiting toxicities are not yet fully defined. We disrupted an HBG1/HBG2 gene promoter motif that is bound by the transcriptional repressor BCL11A. Electroporation of Cas9 single guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex into normal and SCD donor CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells resulted in high frequencies of on-target mutations and the induction of HbF to potentially therapeutic levels in erythroid progeny generated in vitro and in vivo after transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency/Il2rγ-/-/KitW41/W41 immunodeficient mice. On-target editing did not impair CD34+ cell regeneration or differentiation into erythroid, T, B, or myeloid cell lineages at 16 to 17 weeks after xenotransplantation. No off-target mutations were detected by targeted sequencing of candidate sites identified by circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq), an in vitro genome-scale method for detecting Cas9 activity. Engineered Cas9 containing 3 nuclear localization sequences edited human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells more efficiently and consistently than conventional Cas9 with 2 nuclear localization sequences.

This study assesses the feasibility of automating NGS on dried blood spot (DBS) DNA in a United Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) laboratory. An NGS panel targeting the entire coding sequence of five genes relevant to disorders currently screened for in newborns in the UK was validated on DBS DNA. An automated process for DNA extraction, NGS and bioinformatics analysis was developed. The process was tested on DBS to determine feasibility, turnaround time and cost. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 100% and analytical specificity was 99.96%, with a mean 99.5% concordance of variant calls between DBS and venous blood samples in regions with ≥30× coverage (96.8% across all regions; all variant calls were single nucleotide variants (SNVs), with indel performance not assessed). The pipeline enabled processing of up to 1000 samples a week with a turnaround time of four days from receipt of sample to reporting.

In this context, the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been identified as the chief regulator of the transcription of diverse antioxidant genes as well as many other cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 activity is subjected to the regulation at various levels including protein stability, transcription, and post-transcription. Among the various regulatory pathways, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 axis is the most prominent regulator of Nrf2 activity. Being a tightly controlled transcriptional activator of antioxidant genes, Nrf2 signaling is intimately involved in health and disease. While Nrf2 is a protector against oxidative and electrophilic tissue injury, persistent activation of Nrf2 signaling may also contribute to disease pathophysiology, such as cancer progression.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Robert Li, Zhenquan Jia, Hong Zhu<br><b>Journal:</b> React Oxyg Species (Apex)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2380-2367<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692987">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> From fiction to science: clinical potentials and regulatory considerations of gene editing.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 have emerged as an attractive tool not only for scientific research but also for the development of medicinal products.

The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the 100 most-cited research articles (T100) published on prenatal diagnosis.
METHODS: The Web of Science (WOS) database was searched for papers on prenatal diagnosis published between 1900 and 2018. The 100 most-cited original articles and reviews were recorded. Each eligible paper was reviewed for authors, journal name, year of publication, country, institution, total citations, citation density, H-index, research field, article type, and keywords.
RESULTS: The T100 were published between 1972 and 2015 with a mean of 332.7 citations per paper (range: 196-1254). Most of the T100 were published between 1990 and 2005, in 35 journals led by New England Journal of Medicine (n = 14) followed by Lancet (n = 10), and Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (n = 8). Studies on method application, which promotes field development, were the majority article type. The team of Lo YM featured prominently in the field, and the United States of America, United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, China were the leading countries/regions. Frequency of cooperation was also highest among these 3 regions. Hierarchical cluster analysis produced 4 groups of keywords.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides a historical perspective on scientific progress in prenatal diagnosis and may assist clinicians and researchers in assessing the quality of research over the past 50 years. It also provides concise information to guide future research.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-30<br><b>Authors:</b> Meilian Zhang, Yu Zhou, Yanfang Lu, Suhui He, Min Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Medicine (Baltimore)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1536-5964<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567987">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF): how to improve osseointegration in hip arthroplasty secondary to avascular necrosis in sickle cell disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Many studies in the literature have been carried out to evaluate the various cellular and molecular processes involved in osteogenesis.Angiogenesis and bone formation work closely together in this group of disorders. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) which is stimulated in tissue hypoxia triggers a cascade of molecular processes that helps manage this physiological deficiency.However, there still remains a paucity of knowledge with regard to how sickle cell bone pathology, in particular avascular necrosis, could be altered when it comes to osseointegration at the molecular level.Hypoxia-inducible factor has been identified as key in mediating how cells adapt to molecular oxygen levels.The aim of this review is to further elucidate the physiology of hypoxia-inducible factor with its various pathways and to establish what role this factor could play in altering the disease pathophysiology of avascular necrosis caused by sickle cell disease and in improving osseointegration.This review article also seeks to propose certain research methodology frameworks in exploring how osseointegration could be improved in sickle cell disease patients with total hip replacements and how it could eventually reduce their already increased risk of undergoing revision surgery.

Mesenchymal stem cells, obtained from various sources and playing an essential role in organ development and postnatal repair, have exhibited enormous potential for regenerating bone and dental tissue. Currently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based bone and dental regeneration mainly includes two strategies: the rescue or mobilization of endogenous MSCs and the application of exogenous MSCs in cytotherapy or tissue engineering. Nevertheless, the efficacy of MSC-based regeneration is not always fulfilled, especially in diseased microenvironments. Specifically, the diseased microenvironment not only impairs the regenerative potential of resident MSCs but also controls the therapeutic efficacy of exogenous MSCs, both as donors and recipients. Accordingly, approaches targeting a diseased microenvironment have been established, including improving the diseased niche to restore endogenous MSCs, enhancing MSC resistance to a diseased microenvironment and renormalizing the microenvironment to guarantee MSC-mediated therapies. Moreover, the application of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as cell-free therapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the tactics of MSC-based bone and dental regeneration and the decisive role of the microenvironment, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of microenvironment-targeting strategies in bone and dental regenerative medicine.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Zheng, Ji Chen, Shiyu Liu, Yan Jin<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Oral Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2049-3169<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423011">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> CRISPR'd babies: human germline genome editing in the 'He Jiankui affair'.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The world was shocked in Nov. 25, 2018 by the revelation that He Jiankui had used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ('CRISPR') to edit embryos-two of which had, sometime in October, become living babies.

However, the lack of virus-experienced T cells in donor cord blood (CB) has prevented the development of ex vivo expanded donor-derived VSTs for recipients of this stem cell source. Here we evaluated the feasibility and safety of ex vivo expansion of CB T cells from the 20% fraction of the CB unit in pediatric patients receiving a single CB transplant (CBT). In 2 clinical trials conducted at 2 separate sites, we manufactured CB-derived multivirus-specific T cells (CB-VSTs) targeting Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) for 18 (86%) of 21 patients demonstrating feasibility. Manufacturing for 2 CB-VSTs failed to meet lot release because of insufficient cell recovery, and there was 1 sterility breach during separation of the frozen 20% fraction. Delayed engraftment was not observed in patients who received the remaining 80% fraction for the primary CBT. There was no grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with the infusion of CB-VSTs. None of the 7 patients who received CB-VSTs as prophylaxis developed end-organ disease from CMV, EBV, or adenovirus. In 7 patients receiving CB-VSTs for viral reactivation or infection, only 1 patient developed end-organ viral disease, which was in an immune privileged site (CMV retinitis) and occurred after steroid therapy for GVHD. Finally, we demonstrated the long-term persistence of adoptively transferred CB-VSTs using T-cell receptor-Vβ clonotype tracking, suggesting that CB-VSTs are a feasible addition to antiviral pharmacotherapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Allistair A Abraham, Tami D John, Michael D Keller, C Russell N Cruz, Baheyeldin Salem, Lauren Roesch, Hao Liu, Fahmida Hoq, Bambi J Grilley, Adrian P Gee, Hema Dave, David A Jacobsohn, Robert A Krance, Elizabeth J Shpall, Caridad A Martinez, Patrick J Hanley, Catherine M Bollard<br><b>Journal:</b> Blood Adv<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2473-9537<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292125">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Rational targeting of a NuRD subcomplex guided by comprehensive in situ mutagenesis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Developmental silencing of fetal globins serves as both a paradigm of spatiotemporal gene regulation and an opportunity for therapeutic intervention of β-hemoglobinopathy. The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin complex participates in γ-globin repression. We used pooled CRISPR screening to disrupt NuRD protein coding sequences comprehensively in human adult erythroid precursors. Essential for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) control is a non-redundant subcomplex of NuRD protein family paralogs, whose composition we corroborated by affinity chromatography and proximity labeling mass spectrometry proteomics. Mapping top functional guide RNAs identified key protein interfaces where in-frame alleles resulted in loss-of-function due to destabilization or altered function of subunits. We ascertained mutations of CHD4 that dissociate its requirement for cell fitness from HbF repression in both primary human erythroid precursors and transgenic mice. Finally we demonstrated that sequestering CHD4 from NuRD phenocopied these mutations. These results indicate a generalizable approach to discover protein complex features amenable to rational biochemical targeting.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Falak Sher, Mir Hossain, Davide Seruggia, Vivien A C Schoonenberg, Qiuming Yao, Paolo Cifani, Laura M K Dassama, Mitchel A Cole, Chunyan Ren, Divya S Vinjamur, Claudio Macias-Trevino, Kevin Luk, Connor McGuckin, Patrick G Schupp, Matthew C Canver, Ryo Kurita, Yukio Nakamura, Yuko Fujiwara, Scot A Wolfe, Luca Pinello, Takahiro Maeda, Alex Kentsis, Stuart H Orkin, Daniel E Bauer<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat.

A group of rare genetic diseases called the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are characterized by accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans cellularly. MPS results in varied systemic symptoms and in some forms of the disease, neurodegeneration. Lack of treatment options for MPS with neurological involvement necessitates new avenues of therapeutic investigation. Cell and gene therapies provide putative alternatives and when coupled with genome editing technologies may provide long term or curative treatment. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based genome editing technology and, more recently, advances in genome editing research, have allowed for the addition of base editors to the repertoire of CRISPR-based editing tools. The latest versions of base editors are highly efficient on-targeting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) editors. Here, we describe a number of putative guide ribonucleic acid (RNA) designs for precision correction of known causative mutations for 10 of the MPSs. In this review, we discuss advances in base editing technologies and current techniques for delivery of cell and gene therapies to the site of global degeneration in patients with severe neurological forms of MPS, the central nervous system, including ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier disruption.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Chloe L Christensen, Rhea E Ashmead, Francis Y M Choy<br><b>Journal:</b> Diseases<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2079-9721<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248000">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> In vivo dynamics of human hematopoietic stem cells: novel concepts and future directions.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unveiling the mechanisms and the cellular dynamics at the basis of human hematopoietic homeostasis has been a main focus for the scientific community since the discovery of a pool of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) capable of sustaining the hematopoietic output throughout life and after transplantation. Recently, new works shed light on the (1) differentiation paths, (2) size and replication rate of human HSC population at steady state, and (3) role of the distinct subpopulations comprising the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell reservoir after transplantation. These papers exploited cutting-edge technologies, including vector integration site clonal tracking, spontaneous mutations, and deep transcriptome profiling. Here we discuss the latest updates in human hematopoietic system biology and in vivo dynamics, highlighting novel concepts and common findings deriving from different approaches and the future directions of these studies.

A therapeutically effective amount of the oligomer may be administered to a subject patient such that exon skipping during processing of myostatin pre-mRNA is induced. The administration to a subject may be used in order to increase or maintain muscle mass, or slowing degeneration of muscle mass in the subject. The administration to a subject may ameliorate muscle wasting conditions, such as muscular dystrophy. Examples of such muscular dystrophies which may be so treated include Becker's muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, myotonic muscular dystrophy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.<br><b>Patent date:</b> September 24, 2019<br><b>File date:</b> September 12, 2018<br><b><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=49&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=((%22sickle+cell+disease%22+OR+%22beta+thalassemia%22)+AND+((%22gene+therapy%22+OR+%22genome+editing%22)+OR+%22mRNA+therapy%22))&OS=+("sickle+cell+disease"+OR+"beta+thalassemia")+AND+("gene+therapy"+OR+"genome+editing"+OR+"mRNA+therapy")&RS=(("sickle+cell+disease"+OR+"beta+thalassemia")+AND+(("gene+therapy"+OR+"genome+editing")+OR+"mRNA+therapy"))">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Salt forms of (R)-5-((E)-2-pyrrolidin-3-ylvinyl)pyrimidine<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present invention relates to the stereospecific synthesis of (R)-5-((E)-2-pyrrolidin-3-ylvinyl)pyrimidine, its salt forms, and novel polymorphic forms of these salts.<br><b>Patent date:</b> September 24, 2019<br><b>File date:</b> April 25, 2018<br><b><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=50&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=((%22sickle+cell+disease%22+OR+%22beta+thalassemia%22)+AND+((%22gene+therapy%22+OR+%22genome+editing%22)+OR+%22mRNA+therapy%22))&OS=+("sickle+cell+disease"+OR+"beta+thalassemia")+AND+("gene+therapy"+OR+"genome+editing"+OR+"mRNA+therapy")&RS=(("sickle+cell+disease"+OR+"beta+thalassemia")+AND+(("gene+therapy"+OR+"genome+editing")+OR+"mRNA+therapy"))">Link</a></b><br><br><body><html>
