Skeletal muscle weakness progressively develops in DMD patients and usually leads to respiratory failure in the early adolescent years. Cardiac muscle is frequently affected in DMD patients, which leads to a high burden of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In the era of improved respiratory care, cardiac deaths are becoming the major cause of mortality in DMD patients.
CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented to the hospital due to recurrent orthopnea for 6 mo and palpitations for 4 mo. He was diagnosed with progressive muscular dystrophy at the age of 3 years and was confined to a wheelchair at 12 years. He was prescribed diuretics and digoxin at the outpatient clinic; however, his symptoms did not resolve. Sacubitril/valsartan was added 1 mo prior to presentation, but he experienced recurrent episodes of palpitations. The electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 201 bpm, and he was then hospitalized. Hypotension was found following the administration of sacubitril/valsartan tablets; he could not tolerate even a small dose, always developing tachyarrhythmia. His symptoms were relieved after discontinuing sacubitril/valsartan, and his heart rate was controlled by a small dose of metoprolol tartrate and digoxin. Atrial tachycardia spontaneously converted in this patient, and his symptoms attenuated in the following 6 mo, without palpitation episodes.
CONCLUSION: Blood pressure should be closely monitored in DMD patients with advanced heart failure when taking sacubitril/valsartan.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31832414">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Skeletal muscle alterations in tachycardia-induced heart failure are linked to deficient natriuretic peptide signalling and are attenuated by RAS-/NEP-inhibition.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Heart failure induced cachexia is highly prevalent. Insights into disease progression are lacking.
METHODS: Early state of left ventricular dysfunction (ELVD) and symptomatic systolic heart failure (HF) were both induced in rabbits by tachypacing. Tissue of limb muscle (LM) was subjected to histologic assessment. For unbiased characterisation of early and late myopathy, a proteomic approach followed by computational pathway-analyses was performed and combined with pathway-focused gene expression analyses. Specimen of thoracic diaphragm (TD) served as control for inactivity-induced skeletal muscle alterations. In a subsequent study, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-system and neprilysin (RAS-/NEP) was compared to placebo.
RESULTS: HF was accompanied by loss of protein content (8.7±0.4% vs. 7.0±0.5%, mean±SEM, control vs. HF, p<0.01) and a slow-to-fast fibre type switch, establishing hallmarks of cachexia. In ELVD, the enzymatic set-up of LM and TD shifted to a catabolic state. A disturbed malate-aspartate shuttle went well with increased enzymes of glycolysis, forming the enzymatic basis for enforced anoxic energy regeneration. The histological findings and the pathway analysis of metabolic results drew the picture of suppressed PGC-1α signalling, linked to the natriuretic peptide system. In HF, natriuretic peptide signalling was desensitised, as confirmed by an increase in the ratio of serum BNP to tissue cGMP (57.0±18.6pg/ml/nM/ml vs. 165.8±16.76pg/ml/nM/ml, p<0.05) and a reduced expression of natriuretic peptide receptor-A. In HF, combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition prevented from loss in protein content (8.7±0.3% vs. 6.0±0.6% vs. 8.3±0.9%, Baseline vs. HF-Placebo vs. HF-RAS/NEP, p<0.05 Baseline vs. HF-Placebo, p = 0.7 Baseline vs. HF-RAS/NEP).
CONCLUSIONS: Tachypacing-induced heart failure entails a generalised myopathy, preceding systolic dysfunction. The characterisation of "pre-cachectic" state and its progression is feasible. Early enzymatic alterations of LM depict a catabolic state, rendering LM prone to futile substrate metabolism. A combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition ameliorates cardiac-induced myopathy independent of systolic function, which could be linked to stabilised natriuretic peptide/cGMP/PGC-1α signalling.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31800630">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> LCZ696 Therapy Reduces Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Inducibility in a Myocardial Infarction-Induced Heart Failure Rat Model.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: LCZ696 (valsartan/sacubitril) therapy significantly reduced mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Although a clinical trial (PARADISE-MI Trial) has been ongoing to examine the effects of LCZ696 in myocardial infarction (MI) patients, the effects of LCZ696 on remodeling of cardiac electrophysiology in animal models remain largely unclear.
Methods: We performed coronary artery ligation to create MI in Sprague-Dawley rats. Echocardiography was performed one week after MI to confirm the development of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. MI rats were randomly assigned to receive medical therapy for 4 weeks: LCZ696, enalapril, or vehicle. The sham-operation rats received sham operation without MI creation. In vivo electrophysiological exams were performed under general anesthesia. Western blot analyses were conducted to quantify ion channel proteins.
Results: The HF-vehicle group did not show significant changes in LVEF. Both enalapril and LCZ696 therapy significantly improved LVEF. The HF-vehicle group had higher ventricular arrhythmia (VA) inducibility than the sham group. As compared with the HF-vehicle group, LCZ696 therapy significantly reduced VA inducibility, but enalapril therapy did not. Western blot analyses showed significant downregulation of Na
Conclusion: As compared with enalapril therapy, LCZ696 therapy led to improvement of LVEF, reduced VA inducibility, and upregulated expression of K<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772612">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Microvascular Dysfunction in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly studied entity accounting for 50% of all diagnosed heart failure and that has claimed its own dignity being markedly different from heart failure with reduced EF in terms of etiology and natural history (Graziani et al., 2018). Recently, a growing body of evidence points the finger toward microvascular dysfunction as the major determinant of the pathological cascade that justifies clinical manifestations (Crea et al., 2017). The high burden of comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and similar, could lead to a systemic inflammatory state that impacts the physiology of the endothelium and the perivascular environment, engaging complex molecular pathways that ultimately converge to myocardial fibrosis, stiffening, and dysfunction (Paulus and Tschope, 2013). These changes could even self-perpetrate with a positive feedback where hypoxia and locally released inflammatory cytokines trigger interstitial fibrosis and hypertrophy (Ohanyan et al., 2018). Identifying microvascular dysfunction both as the cause and the maintenance mechanism of this condition has opened the field to explore specific pharmacological targets like nitric oxide (NO) pathway, sarcomeric titin, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, immunomodulators or adenosine receptors, trying to tackle the endothelial impairment that lies in the background of this syndrome (Graziani et al., 2018;Lam et al., 2018). Yet, many questions remain, and the new data collected still lack a translation to improved treatment strategies. To further elaborate on this tangled and exponentially growing topic, we will review the evidence favoring a microvasculature-driven etiology of this condition, its clinical correlations, the proposed diagnostic workup, and the available/hypothesized therapeutic options to address microvascular dysfunction in the failing heart.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-21<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31749710">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cardiac Magnetic Resonance in Primary Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Sudden death accounts for 400,000 deaths annually in the United States. Most sudden deaths are cardiac and are related to arrhythmias secondary to structural heart disease or primary electrical abnormalities of the heart. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator significantly improves survival in patients at increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, but better selection of eligible patients is required to avoid unnecessary implantation and identify those patients who may benefit most from this therapy. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) measured by echocardiography has been considered the most reliable parameter for long-term outcome in many cardiac diseases. However, LVEF is an inaccurate parameter for arrhythmic risk assessment as patients with normal or mildly reduced LV systolic function could experience sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Patients with heart failure are at an increased risk of death and morbidity. Traditionally, patients with heart failure have been treated with a beta-blocker in addition to an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, new drugs are currently being added to the recommended guideline therapy. The latest drug to be added combines inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway with inhibiting the neprilysin enzyme and is therefore classified as an ARNI. Our objective is to identify the beneficial and harmful effects of ARNIs in the treatment of patient with heart failure.
METHODS: This protocol for a systematic review was undertaken using the recommendations of the Cochrane, the Preferred Report Items of Systematic reviews with Meta-Analysis Protocols, and the eight-step assessment procedure suggested by Jakobsen and colleagues. We plan to include all relevant randomised clinical trials assessing the use of ARNIs in the treatment of patients with heart failure. We will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science Journal Database (VIP), and BIOSIS to identify relevant trials. We will also search for grey literature and unpublished trials. Extracted data will be analysed using Review Manager 5, STATA 5, and Trial Sequential Analysis. Our primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. We will create a 'Summary of Findings' table in which we will present our primary and secondary outcomes, and we will assess the quality of evidence using the GRADE assessment.
DISCUSSION: The present systematic review will have the potential to aid clinicians in decision-making and thereby, benefit patients with heart failure.

CONCLUSIONS: In real-life conditions, ASV-treatment is often associated with high cardiac comorbidities and high compliance. Future research should assess how regular night monitoring may optimize devices settings and patient management.

Compelling evidence has highlighted the potential of angiotensin (Ang) receptor inhibitors as therapeutic targets in PAH treatment. The present study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Ang II receptor inhibitor LCZ696 treatment in PAH. Initially, a PAH mouse model was induced, followed by intraperitoneal injection of LCZ696. Subsequently, cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were isolated, cultured, and treated with Ang II and LCZ696, followed by detection of the total survival rate, cardiac injury, cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis. Moreover, in order to quantify the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis degree of cardiac fibroblasts, the expression levels of markers of cardiac hypertrophy (ANP, βMHC and TIMP2) and markers of fibrosis (collagen I, collagen III and TGF-β) were evaluated. Furthermore, the potential effect of LCZ696 on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway was examined. The acquired findings revealed that LCZ696 increased the total survival rate of PAH mice, but decreased cardiac injury, cardiac fibrosis, and apoptosis in vitro. LCZ696 attenuated cardiac injury induced by Ang II through the inhibition the expression of markers of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and apoptosis by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, LCZ676 could potentially alleviate cardiac remodeling in mice with PAH via blockade of the ERK signaling pathway activation. Our findings suggest that LCZ696 could be a potential target for PAH therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649814">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Does impaired processing of pro-B-type (or brain) natriuretic peptide cause decreased plasma BNP levels in obese heart failure patients?<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656800">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Diabetic cardiomyopathy: Pathophysiology, theories and evidence to date.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased worldwide and doubled over the last two decades. It features among the top 10 causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of complications in diabetes and within this, heart failure has been shown to be the leading cause of emergency admissions in the United Kingdom. There are many hypotheses and well-evidenced mechanisms by which diabetic cardiomyopathy as an entity develops. This review aims to give an overview of these mechanisms, with particular emphasis on metabolic inflexibility. T2D is associated with inefficient substrate utilisation, an inability to increase glucose metabolism and dependence on fatty acid oxidation within the diabetic heart resulting in mitochondrial uncoupling, glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity and initially subclinical cardiac dysfunction and finally in overt heart failure. The review also gives a concise update on developments within clinical imaging, specifically cardiac magnetic resonance studies to characterise and phenotype early cardiac dysfunction in T2D. A better understanding of the pathophysiology involved provides a platform for targeted therapy in diabetes to prevent the development of early heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641426">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Analysis of Arterial Stiffness in Heart Failure Patients in Comparison with Healthy Subjects and Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None: The arterial stiffness in the pathogenesis and clinical outcome in heart failure (HF) patients still needs to be clarified. An increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in HF patients in comparison with healthy subjects and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) patients has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the arterial stiffness in HF patients in comparison to control populations.
METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted for decompensated heart failure underwent echocardiogram and evaluation of arterial stiffness by measuring the PWV and the augmentation index (AIx75). The arterial stiffness was also calculated in a control group formed by healthy volunteers and in CVRF subjects.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine HF patients (62% males; age 75 years) with mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 38% and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (8111 pg/mL) entered the study. The HF population were compared with 22 healthy controls (age 58 years) and 20 CVRF patients (age 72 years). The analysis of PWV demonstrated a velocity of 10.6 m/s (9-12.1 m/s), 11.7 m/second (10.4-12.8 m/s), and 10.1 m/second (8.6-10.8m/s) in controls, CVRF, and HF patients (

More thorough investigations with the use of indicators of longitudinal systolic function have been therefore recommended to verify whether a part of the clinical improvement achieved with the use of sacubitril/valsartan could be supported by a reverse remodeling ensuing from changes other than a simple LVEF increase.
Methods: In the present retrospective cohort study, which collected the pertinent data from two centers devoted to clinical management of outpatients with CHF and dating back to the years 2017 and 2018, we separated patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan from those treated with conventional medical therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). For the rest, the therapies practiced in the two groups, patients under sacubitril/valsartan and controls, were almost identical, including similar doses of beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in the two cohorts, plus loop diuretics, with the latter administered at variable doses. The endpoints were the variations of LVEF and global left ventricular longitudinal strain (GLS) over a study period not shorter than 1 year.
Results: One hundred thirty-two patients were collected within our retrospective cohort study, of whom 44 were treated with sacubitril/valsartan and 88 were subjected to conventional therapy. All patients were marked by heart failure with reduced (LVEF ≤ 40%) left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF). The mean duration of the retrospective observation period was 14 ± 3 months. In controls, LVEF was improved after a year of therapy from 38.071 ± 5.445% (mean ± standard deviation) to 41.595 ± 5.282%. On the contrary, no significant improvement in the controls could be identified for the GLS, from -12.059 ± 4.016% to -12.250 ± 4.287%. In analogy with controls, patients assigned to sacubitril/valsartan showed a significant increase in LVEF after 1 year of treatment from 39.714 ± 4.789% to 42.119 ± 5.683% (P < 0.001). However, differently from the controls, sacubitril/valsartan group exhibited a significant improvement in GLS from -10.142 ± 3.080% to -18.238 ± 7.284% (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: The present retrospective cohort study demonstrated that the use of sacubitril/valsartan for HFREF patients, extended for a mean duration of 14 months, yields a significant improvement in the echocardiographic parameters of systolic function along the transverse (LVEF) and longitudinal (GLS) axis. For the GLS in particular, a clear superiority emerges in comparison with conventional therapy including ACE inhibitor or ARBs. From these data, the hypothesis could be derived of a possible useful role of sacubitril/valsartan also for the therapy of HFpEF. In this regard, more exhaustive clarifications ensuing from the ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are eagerly awaited.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-22<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636797">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Evaluation of Drug-Related Receptors in Children With Dilated Cardiomyopathy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-21<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632936">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Recent advances in understanding and managing mitral valve disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Interest in the mitral valve has increased over the past few years with the development of new technologies that allow intervention in patients previously deemed too ill for treatment.

We sought to develop a new model of post-CRT care which could be implemented in busy clinical settings.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We designed a novel, multidisciplinary approach to standardizing post CRT care. All patients receiving a CRT device at the Cleveland Clinic between March 2017 and August 2018 were invited to be seen in the clinic 6 months post implant. A one-time collaborative visit encompassing cardiac imaging, heart failure, and electrophysiology care was performed. We recorded the operational feasibility of the clinic in terms of patient throughput as well as patient characteristics, interventions, and new diagnoses made. Between September 2017 and February 2019, 150 patients were seen in the clinic. Of these, 125 patients had their index CRT implanted for standard indications and were included in the current analysis. Approximately 45 minutes were dedicated for each patient visit. Interventions in care were made in 95% of patients, with CRT non-responders offered a higher number of interventions as compared to responders (median 3 versus 2 interventions). Types of interventions were device-related (26% of population), medication-related (74%), and referral for alternate medical services (80%).

Aggressive campaigns by cardiology societies aimed at increasing implementation of these measures in routine practices have almost generalized the treatment of heart failure irrespective of individual variations of clinical status of patients and stages of heart failure. This explains why morbidity compression and quality of life improvement have not been realized fully particularly in patients with advanced disease.

ACC/AHA, ESC Guidelines for CHF, and their updates were reviewed. Clinical trial cited in the guideline documents and other pertaining published literatures were analyzed. FINDINGS: Many of the recommended GDMT for CHF lack unequivocal evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with diverge etiology of heart failure and concomitant comorbid conditions Some of the recommendations which are useful in early stages, lack evidence of efficacy in more advanced stages of heart failure. Application of results of research trials in patients beyond their inclusion and exclusion criteria, appears mere extrapolation, Clinicians are faced with the conundrum of implementing the recommendations without indubitable evidence of their efficacy in every patient of their practice.

Although the physiological action mechanisms of sacubitril/valsartan are well described, its effects on left ventricular (LV) remodelling and other echocardiographic (echo) parameters have not been prospectively studied.
Objective: The aim of this prospective study was to: McMurray et al. (2012) [1] evaluate if sacubitril/valsartan impacts LV remodelling based on echo parameters; Ponikowski et al. (2016) [2] identify the predictive factors of sacubitril/valsartan response or intolerance.
Methods: From May 2017 to September 2018, 52 HF patients were prospectively enrolled using PARADIGM-HF criteria: Class II, III, or IV HF; ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less; hospitalized for HF within the previous 12 months. Echo evaluation was performed before initiating sacubitril/valsartan and 3 months after optimal dose adjustment. Based on previous studies, patients with (absolute) improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 5% were considered significant sacubitril/valsartan responders.
Results: The 52 patients completing the study were characterized by age: 70 ± 10 years; gender: 11women; aetiology: idiopathic in 20 and ischaemic in 32; NYHA Class: II in 17 and III in 35; LVEF: 32 ± 5%; NTProBNP: 1805 ± 1914 pg/mL. The final population comprised 41 pts (79%), as 11 (21%) did not tolerate sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Under sacubitril/valsartan, several echo parameters significantly improved: LVEF from 32.6 ± 5 to 36 ± 6% (
Conclusions: In HFrEF patients, sacubitril/valsartan significantly improves LV systolic remodelling, without any significant effects on LV diastolic or RV systolic echo parameters. Sacubitril/valsartan responders exhibit both less severe LV remodelling and less significant mitral regurgitation. Accordingly, sacubitril/valsartan could be used as soon as possible in HFrEF patients in order to limit LV remodelling, while precluding non-response or intolerance.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517034">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Antisense regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide expression.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The cardiac hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a central regulator of blood volume and a therapeutic target in hypertension and heart failure. Enhanced ANP activity in such conditions through inhibition of the degradative enzyme neprilysin has shown clinical efficacy but is complicated by consequences of simultaneous accumulation of a heterogeneous array of other hormones. Targets for specific ANP enhancement have not been available. Here, we describe a cis-acting antisense transcript (NPPA-AS1), which negatively regulates ANP expression in human cardiomyocytes. We show that NPPA-AS1 regulates ANP expression via facilitating NPPA repressor RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) binding to its promoter, rather than forming an RNA duplex with ANP mRNA. Expression of ANP mRNA and NPPA-AS1 was increased and correlated in isolated strained human cardiomyocytes and in hearts from patients with advanced heart failure. Further, inhibition of NPPA-AS1 in vitro and in vivo resulted in increased myocardial expression of ANP, increased circulating ANP, increased renal cGMP, and lower blood pressure. The effects of NPPA-AS1 inhibition on NPPA expression in human cardiomyocytes were further marked under cell-strain conditions. Collectively, these results implicate the antisense transcript NPPA-AS1 as part of a physiologic self-regulatory ANP circuit and a viable target for specific ANP augmentation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-10<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503546">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators in patients with left ventricular assist devices: case report and comprehensive review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly used in patients with advanced heart failure, many of whom have been or will be implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Interaction between both devices is a matter of concern. Subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) obtains its signals through subcutaneous vectors, which poses special challenges with regards to adequate performance following LVAD implantation.
CASE SUMMARY: We describe the case of a 24-year-old man implanted with an S-ICD because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe biventricular dysfunction, and self-limiting sustained ventricular tachycardias. After the implantation of a HeartMate 3™ (Left Ventricular Assist System, Abbott) several months later, the S-ICD became useless because of inappropriate sensing due to electromagnetic interference and attenuation of QRS voltage.
DISCUSSION: We reviewed the reported cases in PubMed about the concomitant use of S-ICD and LVAD. Seven case reports about the performance of S-ICD in patients with an LVAD were identified, with discordant results. From these articles, we analyse the potential causes for these differing results. Pump location and operating rates in LVAD, as well as changes in the subcutaneous-electrocardiogram detected by the S-ICD after LVAD implantation are related to sensing disturbances when used in the same patient.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449611">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> 6-minute walking test: a useful tool in the management of heart failure patients.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Reduced functional ability and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure (HF) are associated with poor quality of life and a worse prognosis. The 6-minute walking test (6MWT) is a widely available and well-tolerated test for the assessment of the functional capacity of patients with HF. Although the cardiopulmonary exercise test (a maximal exercise test) remains the gold standard for the evaluation of exercise capacity in patients with HF, the 6MWT (submaximal exercise test) may provide reliable information about the patient's daily activity. The current review summarizes the value of 6MWT in patients with HF and identifies its usefulness and limitations in everyday clinical practice in populations of HF. We aimed to investigate potential associations of 6MWD with other measures of functional status and determinants of 6MWD in patients with HF as well as to review its prognostic role and changes to various interventions in these patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-23<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31441375">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Role of Targeted Therapy in Dilated Cardiomyopathy: The Challenging Road Toward a Personalized Approach.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-22<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433726">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Meeting abstracts from the 9th International Conference on cGMP: Generators, Effectors and Therapeutic Implications.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-15<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412886">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Current pharmacological therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are largely either repurposed anti-hypertensives that blunt overactivation of the neurohormonal system or diuretics that decrease congestion. However, they do not address the symptoms of heart failure that result from reductions in cardiac output and reserve. Over the last few decades, numerous attempts have been made to develop and test positive cardiac inotropes that improve cardiac haemodynamics. However, definitive clinical trials have failed to show a survival benefit. As a result, no positive inotrope is currently approved for long-term use in heart failure. The focus of this state-of-the-art review is to revisit prior clinical trials and to understand the causes for their findings. Using the learnings from those experiences, we propose a framework for future trials of such agents that maximizes their potential for success. This includes enriching the trials with patients who are most likely to derive benefit, using biomarkers and imaging in trial design and execution, evaluating efficacy based on a wider range of intermediate phenotypes, and collecting detailed data on functional status and quality of life. With a rapidly growing population of patients with advanced heart failure, the epidemiologic insignificance of heart transplantation as a therapeutic intervention, and both the cost and morbidity associated with ventricular assist devices, there is an enormous potential for positive inotropic therapies to impact the outcomes that matter most to patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-13<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31407860">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Evolution of mitral regurgitation in patients with heart failure referred to a tertiary heart failure clinic.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-07<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390167">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pathophysiology of narrow complex dilated cardiomyopathy insight derived from the velocity equation: velocity = distance/time.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The pathophysiology of narrow complex dilated cardiomyopathy is not defined, so therapeutic options are limited. By utilising the velocity equation, the pathophysiology of narrow complex cardiomyopathy allows above normal conduction propagation velocities. There are two pathophysiological theories that allow above normal conduction velocities and failure to capture the myocardium: (1)insulating fibres of the conduction system extending beyond the apex and (2) reduction of axon branching. A patient with narrow complex cardiomyopathy was subjected to graded increase in amplitude and pulse width pacing to overcome the failure of native conduction to capture the myocardium. Peak systolic strain maps demonstrated a progressive increase in apical contractility with increasing pulse width and amplitude. Ejection fraction improved from 17% to 31%. Understanding the pathophysiology of narrow complex cardiomyopathy leads to proposed therapies.

Endothelium-derived nitric oxide is a major vasodilator in large-size vessels, and the hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells mediated by the endothelium plays a central role in agonist-mediated and flow-mediated vasodilation in resistance-size vessels. Although the mechanisms underlying diabetic vascular complications are multifactorial and complex, impairment of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDH) of vascular smooth muscle cells would contribute at least partly to the initiation and progression of microvascular complications of diabetes. In this review, we present the current knowledge about the pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms of impaired EDH in diabetes in animals and humans.

Induction of renal pro-oxidant enzymes with excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accumulation of dityrosine-containing protein products produced during oxidative stress (advanced oxidation protein products-AOPPs) have been directly linked to podocyte damage, proteinuria, and the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) as well as tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Vascular oxidative stress is considered to play a critical role in CKD progression, and ROS are potential mediators of the impaired myogenic responses of afferent renal arterioles in CKD and impaired renal autoregulation. Both oxidative stress and inflammation are CKD hallmarks. Oxidative stress promotes inflammation via formation of proinflammatory oxidized lipids or AOPPs, whereas activation of nuclear factor κB transcription factor in the pro-oxidant milieu promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of proinflammatory cells. Accumulating evidence implicates oxidative stress in various clinical models of CKD, including diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease as well as the cardiorenal syndrome. The scope of this review is to tackle the issue of oxidative stress in CKD in a holistic manner so as to provide a future framework for potential interventions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-31<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362427">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Featuring: Eugene Braunwald.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-30<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360236">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Echocardiographic assessment of functional mitral regurgitation: opening Pandora's box?<br><b>Abstract:</b> Two recent trials of transcatheter mitral-valve repair in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) presented opposing results for the MitraClip® compared to medical therapy alone.

A recent editorial viewpoint provided a potential explanation presenting a new pathophysiologic concept. However, the echocardiographic characterization of both trials' patients is inconsistent and the discussed concepts appear to suffer from plausibility weaknesses. It is well conceivable that limitations in the echocardiographic assessment of the trial patients introduced a bias regarding the selection of patients with severe (or less severe) MR that may be a more plausible explanation for the differences in outcome.

Indeed, outcomes in late stages of HF approximate those seen in patients with various aggressive malignancies. Clinical trials assessing beneficial outcomes of new treatments in patients with cancer have used innovative approaches to measure impact on total disease burden or surrogates to assess treatment efficacy. Although most cardiovascular outcomes trials continue to use time-to-first event analyses to assess the primary efficacy end point, such analyses do not adequately reflect the impact of new treatments on the totality of the chronic disease burden. Consequently, patient enrichment and other strategies for ongoing clinical trial design, as well as new statistical methodologies, are important considerations, particularly when studying a population with advanced chronic HF. The DREAM-HF trial (Double-Blind Randomized Assessment of Clinical Events With Allogeneic Mesenchymal Precursor Cells in Advanced Heart Failure) is an ongoing, randomized, sham-controlled phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal precursor cells as immunotherapy in patients with advanced chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. Mesenchymal precursor cells have a unique multimodal mechanism of action that is believed to result in polarization of proinflammatory type 1 macrophages in the heart to an anti-inflammatory type 2 macrophage state, inhibition of maladaptive adverse left ventricular remodeling, reversal of cardiac and peripheral endothelial dysfunction, and recovery of deranged vasculature. The objective of DREAM-HF is to confirm earlier phase 2 results and evaluate whether mesenchymal precursor cells will reduce the rate of nonfatal recurrent HF-related major adverse cardiac events while delaying or preventing progression of HF to terminal cardiac events. DREAM-HF is an example of an ongoing contemporary events-driven cardiovascular cell-based immunotherapy study that has utilized the concepts of baseline disease enrichment, prognostic enrichment, and predictive enrichment to improve its efficiency by using accumulating data from within as well as external to the trial. Adaptive enrichment designs and strategies are important components of a rational approach to achieve clinical research objectives in shorter clinical trial timelines and with increased cost-effectiveness without compromising ethical standards or the overall statistical integrity of the study. The DREAM-HF trial also presents an alternative approach to traditional composite time-to-first event primary efficacy end points. Statistical methodologies such as the joint frailty model provide opportunities to expand the scope of events-driven HF with reduced ejection fraction clinical trials to utilize time to recurrent nonfatal HF-related major adverse cardiac events as the primary efficacy end point without compromising the integrity of the statistical analyses for terminal cardiac events. In advanced chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction studies, the joint frailty model is utilized to reflect characteristics of the high-risk patient population with important unmet therapeutic needs. In some cases, use of the joint frailty model may substantially reduce sample size requirements. In addition, using an end point that is acceptable to the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, such as recurrent nonfatal HF-related major adverse cardiac events, enables generation of clinically relevant pharmacoeconomic data while providing comprehensive views of the patient's overall cardiovascular disease burden. The major goal of this review is to provide lessons learned from the ongoing DREAM-HF trial that relate to biologic plausibility and flexible clinical trial design and are potentially applicable to other development programs of innovative therapies for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease.

We, therefore, conducted this 2019 focused update of the guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology for the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure to reinforce the importance of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of heart failure. The 2019 focused update discusses new diagnostic criteria, pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological management, and certain co-morbidities of heart failure. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and If channel inhibitor is introduced as new and recommended medical therapies. Latest criteria of cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, heart transplantation, and ventricular assist device therapy are reviewed in the non-pharmacological management chapter. Co-morbidities in heart failure are discussed including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sleep-disordered breathing. We also explain the adequate use of oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation in heart failure management. A particular chapter for chemotherapy-induced cardiac toxicity is incorporated in the focused update to emphasize the importance of its recognition and management. Lastly, implications from the TSOC-HFrEF registry and post-acute care of heart failure are discussed to highlight the importance of guideline-directed medical therapy and the benefits of multidisciplinary disease management programs.

Studies of ambulatory patients found that a minority are prescribed optimal doses. However, dose at hospital discharge has rarely been reported. This information may guide quality improvement initiatives during and following discharge.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 370 consecutive patients with HFrEF hospitalized at two centres in Vancouver, Canada. Of those without contraindications, 86.4%, 93.4%, and 44.7% were prescribed an ACE-I/ARB/sacubitril-valsartan, beta-blocker, or MRA, respectively. The proportion of eligible patients prescribed target dose was respectively 28.6%, 31.7%, and 4.1%. Forty-two of 248 eligible patients (16.9%) were prescribed ≥50% of target dose, and only three patients received target dosing of all three medication classes. In multivariate regression models, cardiologist involvement in care was independently associated with increased dose and prescription of ≥50% of target dose for all medications, whereas a history of HF was only predictive for beta-blockers.
CONCLUSIONS: In a single-region experience of hospitalized HFrEF patients, a high proportion of eligible patients were discharged on ACE-I/ARB or beta-blocker. Less than half were prescribed MRAs, and few were prescribed ≥50% or target dosing of all medications.

It is the most common type of heart failure in the elderly and its prevalence increases with age and is higher in females at any given age. HFpEF is frequently accompanied of comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, atrial fibrillation and renal dysfunction. The diagnosis relies in the integration of clinical information, laboratory data and interpretation of cardiac imaging and hemodynamic findings at rest and during exercise.

Aggressive management of comorbidities, optimization of blood pressure control and volume status using diuretics as needed are among the current treatment recommendations.

Multiple statistical approaches are currently being tested to account for recurrent events such as hospitalisations for heart failure or to combine binary and continuous outcomes, both intended to assess the holistic burden of the disease, as opposed to the traditional analysis of time to first event.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-10<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179020">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Sacubitril/Valsartan in Asian Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The Prospective comparison of Angiotensin Receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) with Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure (HF) trial (PARADIGM-HF) showed that adding a neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril) to a renin-angiotensin system blocker (and other standard therapy) reduced morbidity and mortality in ambulatory patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In PARADIGM-HF, valsartan combined with sacubitril (a so-called ARNI) was superior to the current gold standard of an ACEI, specifically enalapril, reducing the risk of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular (CV) death or first HF hospitalization by 20% and all-cause death by 16%. Following the results of PARADIGM-HF, sacubitril/valsartan was approved by American and European regulatory authorities for the treatment of HFrEF.

The most widely-used HF diagnostic method, echocardiography, incurs a decreased diagnostic accuracy for heart failure disease progression when patients are asymptomatic compared to those who are symptomatic. The purpose of this study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of heart failure diagnosis comparing echocardiography to a novel myocardial strain assessment (Fast-SENC), which utilizes cardiac-tagged magnetic resonance imaging.
METHODS: We develop two models, one from the perspective of payers and one from the perspective of purchasers (hospitals). The payer model is a cost-effectiveness model composed of a 1-year short-term model and a lifetime horizon model. The hospital/purchaser model is a cost impact model where expected costs are calculated by multiplying cost estimates of each subcomponent by the accompanying probability.
RESULTS: The payer model shows lower healthcare costs for Fast-SENC in comparison to ECHO ($24,647 vs. $39,097) and a lifetime savings of 37% when utilizing Fast-SENC. Similarly, the hospital model revealed that the total cost per HF patient visit is $184 for ECHO and $209 for Fast-SENC, which results in hospital contribution margins of $81 and $115, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Fast-SENC is associated with higher quality-adjusted life years and lower accumulated expected healthcare costs than echocardiogram patients. Fast-SENC also shows a significant short-term and lifetime cost-savings difference and a higher hospital contribution margin when compared to echocardiography. These results suggest that early discovery of heart failure with methods like Fast-SENC can be cost-effective when followed by the appropriate treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123926">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Does the heart transplant have a future?<br><b>Abstract:</b> Heart failure has remained the leading cause of death globally for the last 15 years-and its prevalence will continue to rise. Fifty years ago, heart failure management was enriched by the possibility of a heart transplant. Despite impressive improvements in medical treatment for heart failure, a heart transplant remains the most effective long-lasting treatment for advanced heart failure in terms of mortality and quality of life. However, donor and recipient characteristics have changed dramatically in recent years, leading to more complex decision-making regarding organ acceptance and to more demanding operations and postoperative management. With improving pathophysiological understanding in the last decades, today's scientific interest still focuses on basic knowledge. How to retrieve and conserve organs to minimize ischaemic injury; how best to allocate them, considering the likelihood of success (developing a heart-allocation scoring system similar to that for lung allocation); how to match donor/recipient characteristics (ABO blood-group antigen compatibility versus incompatibility); and how to avoid graft failure, rejection and secondary morbidities such as malignomas and cardiac allograft vasculopathy after the heart transplant-all these factors remain fundamental challenges in today's transplant medicine. The use of ex vivo perfusion (e.g. via the Organ Care System®, TransMedics, Andover, MA, USA) may play an important role in this change. Remarkably, there are huge regional divergences in current transplant practices: Whereas the number of transplants continues to rise in most Eurotransplant countries and other major transplant networks, there are some countries in which transplant numbers are static or even dropping (as in Germany). This difference results in wide variations across different countries as to how advanced heart failure is treated using mechanical circulatory-assist devices.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-20<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106338">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> New Approaches in the Management of Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients with Heart Failure-Targeting the Sympathetic Nervous System.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been considered the most predominant cause of death and one of the most critical public health issues worldwide. In the past two decades, cardiovascular (CV) mortality has declined in high-income countries owing to preventive measures that resulted in the reduced burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). In spite of these promising results, CVDs are responsible for ~17 million deaths per year globally with ~25% of these attributable to sudden cardiac death (SCD). Pre-clinical data demonstrated that renal denervation (RDN) decreases sympathetic activation as evaluated by decreased renal catecholamine concentrations. RDN is successful in reducing ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) triggering and its outcome was not found inferior to metoprolol in rat myocardial infarction model. Registry clinical data also suggest an advantageous effect of RDN to prevent VAs in HF patients and electrical storm. An in-depth investigation of how RDN, a minimally invasive and safe method, reduces the burden of HF is urgently needed. Myocardial systolic dysfunction is correlated to neuro-hormonal overactivity as a compensatory mechanism to keep cardiac output in the face of declining cardiac function. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity is supported by a rise in plasma noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline levels, raised central sympathetic outflow, and increased organ-specific spillover of NA into plasma. Cardiac NA spillover in untreated HF individuals can reach ~50-fold higher levels compared to those of healthy individuals under maximal exercise conditions. Increased sympathetic outflow to the renal vascular bed can contribute to the anomalies of renal function commonly associated with HF and feed into a vicious cycle of elevated BP, the progression of renal disease and worsening HF. Increased sympathetic activity, amongst other factors, contribute to the progress of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to SCD due to sustained ventricular tachycardia. Targeted therapies to avoid these detrimental consequences comprise antiarrhythmic drugs, surgical resection, endocardial catheter ablation and use of the implantable electronic cardiac devices.

These roles are conveyed via two cognate receptors, natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B) and natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C), which activate different signalling pathways that mediate complementary yet distinct cellular responses. Traditionally, CNP has been deemed the endothelial component of the natriuretic peptide system, while its sibling peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are considered the endocrine guardians of cardiac function and blood volume. However, accumulating evidence indicates that CNP not only modulates vascular tone and blood pressure, but also governs a wide range of cardiovascular effects including the control of inflammation, angiogenesis, smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation, atherosclerosis, cardiomyocyte contractility, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac electrophysiology. This review will focus on the novel physiological functions ascribed to CNP, the receptors/signalling mechanisms involved in mediating its cardioprotective effects, and the development of therapeutics targeting CNP signalling pathways in different disease pathologies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-10<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072047">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2018: A Summary of Key Clinical Trials.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Many important clinical trials in cardiology were published or presented at major international meetings throughout 2018. This paper aims to offer a concise overview of these significant advances and to put them into clinical context.
METHODS: Trials presented at the major international cardiology meetings during 2018 were reviewed including The American College of Cardiology, EuroPCR, The European Society of Cardiology, PCR London Valves, Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, and the American Heart Association. In addition to this a literature search identified several other publications eligible for inclusion based on their relevance to clinical cardiology, their potential impact on clinical practice and on future guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 78 trials met the inclusion criteria. New interventional and structural data include trials examining novel stent designs (Biofreedom™, COMBO), use of drug-coated balloons in patients with high bleeding risk, intervention in stable coronary artery disease, revascularisation strategy in ST elevation myocardial infarction, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, and percutaneous mitral or tricuspid valve interventions. Preventative cardiology data included the use of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin), proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (alirocumab) and approaches of hypertension management. Antiplatelet data included trials evaluating both the optimal length of course and combination of antiplatelet agents. Heart failure data included trials of sacubitril-valsartan during acute hospital admission and the management of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Electrophysiology data included trials examining atrial fibrillation ablation, wearable cardiac defibrillators (LifeVest) and His-bundle pacing.

In contrast, the trajectory of both investment in development as well as new drug approvals for oncology have been increasing steadily over the same time frame. The factors that have spurred drug development in oncology may be applicable to new efforts to overcome barriers to drug development for CVD. Greater investment in basic research and application of expedited regulatory pathways have contributed to a lowering of development barriers in oncology. Barriers in implementation are also critical. More rapid adoption of guideline-based therapies and lower access barriers by payers have contributed to fewer implementation barriers for oncology therapeutics. There is substantially greater advocacy among patients and physicians for new oncology therapeutics, and such advocacy efforts are likely to have had a meaningful impact on lowering barriers to develop new oncology therapeutics. Broad support of patient and physician advocacy efforts directed towards CVD may help overcome existing development and implementation barriers to new drug development, thereby spurring more rapid progress in the fight to eradicate cardiovascular disease.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-07<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061928">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Effects of neprilysin-renin inhibition in comparison with neprilysin-angiotensin inhibition on the neurohumoral changes in rats with heart failure.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The activation of neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms is a common physiological phenomenon in heart failure in order to make up for a failing heart, which will usually have a deteriorating effect on overall health condition. Many medications, such as neprilysin and angiotensin inhibitors, have recently been introduced to remediate neurohumoral changes. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the sacubitril-aliskiren combination versus the sacubitril-ramipril combination in the treatment of neurohumoral changes in rats with experimentally induced heart failure.
METHOD: Thirty Wister rats were randomly assigned into five groups each of six rats, the first group was the control group. Intraperitoneal isoprenaline injections of 5 mg/kg/day for 1 week were used to induce experimental models of heart failure in rats of the rest of experimental groups. The second group served as a positive control. Rats in the third, fourth, and fifth groups received oral daily dose of sacubitril 30 mg/kg/day, sacubitril-aliskiren 30,10 mg/kg/day, and sacubitril-ramipril 30/10 mg/kg/day respectively, for 2 weeks.
RESULTS: Induction of heart failure in rats has significantly increased circulating NT-proBNP (980 ± 116.71 pg/ml), MMP9 (15.85 ± 0.57 ng/ml), troponin-I (3.09 ± 0.147 ng/ml), CK-MB (31.55 ± 1.69 ng/ml), renin (736 ± 45.8 pg/ml), urea (52.1 ± 1.57 mg/dl), and creatinine (0.92 ± 0.04 mg/dl). Significant decreases in glomerular filtration rate (7.031 ± 1.6 ml/hr./kg), urine flow (0.2761 ± 0.06 ml/h/kg), total solute excretion (0.11 ± 0.03 meq/m), and mean blood pressure (83.5 ± 2.6 mm hg) were seen in rats with heart failure. Rats treated with sacubitril combined with aliskiren or ramipril showed a statistically significant reduction of NT-proBNP, MMP9, troponin serum urea, and serum creatinine. Sacubitril-aliskiren or sacubitril-ramipril administration produced a significant increase in renin plasma level, total solute excretion, urine flow, and glomerular filtration rate.
CONCLUSION: Sacubitril in combination with aliskiren or with ramipril effectively reduced plasma cardiac biomarkers, such as CK-MB, MMP9, and NT-proBNP, in rats with heart failure. Both combinations showed significant remediation of renal function through increasing GFR, urine flow, and total solute excretion, as well as reducing plasma level of renin. Net results revealed that the sacubitril-aliskiren combination has similar remediating effects on neurohumoral changes compared to the sacubitril-ramipril combination.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-05<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053170">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Nine contemporary therapeutic directions in heart failure.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The global burden of heart failure has continued to increase dramatically with 26 million people affected and an estimated health expenditure of $31 billion worldwide.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study of 26 191 adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) in the IMS® longitudinal prescriptions database in Germany who were dispensed sac/val from January 2016 to June 2017 was conducted. The analysis included sac/val dose titration assessed in the 6 months from first sac/val prescription; prescriptions of concomitant cardiovascular medications in the 6 months pre- and post-index and compliance and persistence during 12 months post-index. Two-thirds of patients were prescribed the lowest sac/val dose of 50 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) at index and up-titration during the first 6 months was attempted in 41% of these patients. Ten percent of patients prescribed 200 mg b.i.d. at index had to be stably down-titrated; among patients prescribed 50 or 100 mg b.i.d. at index that were up-titrated, > 80% remained on the higher dose. Overall, the mean daily diuretic dose decreased by 25% after initiation of sac/val. High compliance and persistence rates were observed across sac/val doses, increasing with higher sac/val dose at index. Prior dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker had only minor impact on first sac/val dose, compliance and persistence.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients prescribed sac/val are not initiated on the recommended dose nor up-titrated as recommended by the EU Summary of Product Characteristics. Initiation of sac/val was associated with high persistence and compliance and a dose reduction of diuretics.

The degree of constriction "tightness" dictates the TAC severity and is determined by the gauge (G) of needle used. Though many reports use the TAC model, few studies have directly compared the range of resulting phenotypes. In this study adult male mice were randomized to receive TAC surgery with varying degrees of tightness: mild (25G), moderate (26G) or severe (27G) for 4 weeks, alongside sham-operated controls. Weekly echocardiography and terminal haemodynamic measurements determined cardiac remodelling and function. All TAC models induced significant, severity-dependent left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction compared to sham mice. Mice subjected to 26G TAC additionally exhibited mild systolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, whereas mice in the 27G TAC group had more severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, severe cardiac fibrosis, and were more likely to display features of heart failure, such as elevated plasma BNP. We also observed renal atrophy in 27G TAC mice, in the absence of renal structural, functional or gene expression changes. 25G, 26G and 27G TAC produced different responses in terms of cardiac structure and function.

It is now emerging that neurohumoral mechanisms activated during heart failure, with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction, modulate cells of the immune system. Indeed, these cells express angiotensin I receptors, adrenoceptors, and natriuretic peptides receptors. Ang II modulates macrophage polarization, promoting M2 macrophages phenotype, and this stimulation can influence lymphocytes Th1/Th2 balance. β-AR activation in monocytes is responsible for inhibition of free oxygen radicals production, and together with α2-AR can modulate TNF-α receptor expression and TNF-α release. In dendritic cells, activation of β2-AR inhibits IL-12 production, resulting in the inhibition of Th1 and promotion of Th2 differentiation. ANP induces the activation of secretion of superoxide anion in polymorphonucleated cells; reduces TNF-α and nitric oxide secretion in macrophages; and attenuates the exacerbated TH1 responses. BNP in macrophages can stimulate ROS production, up-regulates IL-10, and inhibits IL-12 and TNF-α release by dendritic cells, suggesting an anti-inflammatory cytokines profile induction. Therefore, different neurohormonal-immune cross-talks can determine the phenotype of cardiac remodeling, promoting either favorable or maladaptive responses. This review aims to summarize the available knowledge on neurohormonal modulation of immune responses, providing supportive rational background for further research.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959745">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> After having changed the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what are the latest evidences with sacubitril valsartan?<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923547">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Do the Natriuretic Peptides Cause Atrial Fibrillation or is it Not So Black and White?<br><b>Abstract:</b> See Article by Whitman et al.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909777">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF).<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of incident heart failure hospitalization in individuals with type 2 diabetes who have, or are at high risk of, cardiovascular disease.

Myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction have been considered the hallmarks of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), while systolic function is affected in the latter stages of the disease. In this article we propose the potential pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for myocardial hypertrophy and increased myocardial stiffness leading to diastolic dysfunction in this specific entity. According to our model, increased myocardial stiffness results from both cellular and extracellular matrix stiffness as well as cell⁻matrix interactions. Increased intrinsic cardiomyocyte stiffness is probably the most important contributor to myocardial stiffness. It results from the impairment in cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton. Several other mechanisms, specifically affected by diabetes, seem to also be significantly involved in myocardial stiffening, i.e., impairment in the myocardial nitric oxide (NO) pathway, coronary microvascular dysfunction, increased inflammation and oxidative stress, and myocardial sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2)-mediated effects. Better understanding of the complex pathophysiology of DCM suggests the possible value of drugs targeting the listed mechanisms.

Methods and Results Of 5625 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute HF in the KorAHF (Registry [Prospective Cohort] for Heart Failure in Korea) study, 5103 patients had baseline echocardiography and 2302 patients had follow-up echocardiography at 12 months. HF phenotypes were defined as persistent HF r EF ( LVEF ≤40% at baseline and at 1-year follow-up), HF i EF ( LVEF ≤40% at baseline and improved up to 40% at 1-year follow-up), HF with midrange ejection fraction (LVEF between 40% and <50%), and HF with preserved ejection fraction ( LVEF ≥50%). The primary outcome was 4-year all-cause mortality from the time of HF i EF diagnosis. Among 1509 HF r EF patients who had echocardiography 1 year after index hospitalization, 720 (31.3%) were diagnosed as having HF i EF .

During 4-year follow-up, patients with HF i EF showed lower mortality than those with persistent HF r EF in univariate, multivariate, and propensity-score-matched analyses. β-Blockers, but not renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, were associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio: 0.59; 95% CI , 0.40-0.87; P=0.007).

Conclusions HF i EF is a distinct HF phenotype with better clinical outcomes than other phenotypes. The use of β-blockers may be beneficial for these patients.

Patients progress to a condition where traditional treatment is no longer effective and advanced therapies, such as mechanical circulatory support, heart transplantation and/or palliative care, are needed. This condition is called advanced chronic heart failure. The Heart Failure Association first defined it in 2007 and this definition was updated in 2018. The updated version emphasises the role of comorbidities, including tachyarrhythmias, and the role of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Improvements in mechanical circulatory support technology and better disease management programmes are major advances and are radically changing the management of these patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-08<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847238">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Natriuretic Peptides in Chronic Heart Failure.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Normal brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) levels are helpful in excluding chronic heart failure in the ambulatory setting, although they have been studied less well and possibly less accurately than in acute care. They may also be of help in screening patients at risk to intervene and reduce the development of heart failure. Natriuretic peptides are also excellent prognostic markers of chronic heart failure, but the clinical value of such prognostic information is less clear. One possible application for this information is guiding medical therapy in chronic heart failure. Many studies have investigated this approach, but results are mixed and do not clearly show improvement in outcome. Still, it may be that in patients with reduced ejection fraction and few comorbidities, measuring NT-proBNP to uptitrate medication improves prognosis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-08<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847245">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its suppression.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) promotes and perpetuates the syndromes of congestive heart failure, systemic hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Excessive circulating and tissue angiotensin II (AngII) and aldosterone levels lead to a pro-fibrotic, -inflammatory, and -hypertrophic milieu that causes remodeling and dysfunction in cardiovascular and renal tissues. Understanding of the role of the RAAS in this abnormal pathologic remodeling has grown over the past few decades and numerous medical therapies aimed at suppressing the RAAS have been developed. Despite this, morbidity from these diseases remains high. Continued investigation into the complexities of the RAAS should help clinicians modulate (suppress or enhance) components of this system and improve quality of life and survival. This review focuses on updates in our understanding of the RAAS and the pathophysiology of AngII and aldosterone excess, reviewing what is known about its suppression in cardiovascular and renal diseases, especially in the cat and dog.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-02-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30806496">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Early Effects of Sacubitril/Valsartan on Exercise Tolerance in Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was shown to be superior to enalapril in reducing the risk of death and hospitalization for HF. Our aim was to evaluate the cardiopulmonary effects of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HFrEF.
METHODS: We conducted an observational study. Ninety-nine ambulatory patients with HFrEF underwent serial cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) after initiation of sacubitril/valsartan in addition to recommended therapy.
RESULTS: At baseline, 37% of patients had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III. After a median follow-up of 6.2 months (range 3⁻14.9 months) systolic blood pressure decreased from 117 ± 14 to 101 ± 12 mmHg (

Medical advancements in the treatment of CVD have led to patients living longer with CVD but often progressing to another condition called heart failure (HF). As a result, HF has emerged in the last decade as a major medical concern. Fortunately, various "traditional" pharmacotherapies for HF exist and have shown success in reducing HF-associated mortality. However, to augment the treatment of patients with CVD and/or HF, alternative pharmacotherapies using nutraceuticals have also shown promise in the prevention and treatment of these two conditions. One of these natural compounds considered to potentially help treat HF and CVD and prevent their development is resveratrol. Herein, we review the clinical findings of resveratrol's ability to be used as an effective treatment to potentially help treat HF and CVD. This will allow us to gain a more fulsome appreciation for the effects of resveratrol in the health outcomes of specific patient populations who have various disorders that constitute CVD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-02-22<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791450">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> American Heart Association 2018 Scientific Sessions.<br><b>Abstract:</b> We report on sessions on the dapagliflozin effect on cardiovascular events; angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition for acute decompensated heart failure; rivaroxaban's effect on thromboembolic events with heart failure, sinus rhythm, and coronary disease; trial results on the withdrawal of pharmacological heart failure therapy in recovered dilated cardiomyopathy; and more from AHA's November meeting.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-02-15<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30766010">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Potential and Limitations of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide as Biomarker in Pediatric Heart Failure-A Comparative Review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Although B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP), and mid-regional-proANP (MR-proANP) are included in current guidelines on heart failure in adults, no guideline considering these biomarkers in pediatric heart failure is available. A new drug class of neprilysin inhibitors as fixed-dose combination (Sacubitril/valsartan) has been introduced and is currently being investigated in children suffering from heart failure. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) is discussed as a more useful alternative to BNP because it may grants better insights into the effects of this treatment. Thus, this review aimed to provide an overview of the current knowledge concerning ANP in pediatric heart failure and compares its suitability regarding diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. A literature search using PubMed resulted in 147 publications of which 22 studies were classified as relevant. The review presents available ANP, NT-proANP, and MR-proANP level data in children (0-18 years). Summarizing, ANP shows only minor differences as marker for diagnosing and monitoring pediatric heart failure if compared to BNP. Due to its fast release, ANP offers the advantage of displaying rapid changes during therapy or operation. ANP is -like the other natriuretic peptides- influenced by age, presenting with the highest levels in very young infants. ANP also correlates with atrial pressure and volume overload in children. In addition, ANP determination in saliva appears to be a promising alternative to blood sampling. Similarly to NT-proBNP, NT-proANP, and MR-proANP offer better stability but only few data has been published in children and thus their potential is only presumable so far.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-02-14<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761275">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cardio-oncology: management of cardiovascular toxicity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Traditional chemotherapeutic agents and newer targeted therapies for cancer have the potential to cause cardiovascular toxicities.

However, adoption of ARNI into clinical practice has been slow. Factors influencing use of ARNI have not been fully elucidated. Using data from the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry, Hospital Compare, Dartmouth Atlas, and the American Hospital Association Survey, we sought to identify hospital characteristics associated with patient-level receipt of an ARNI prescription. Methods and Results We analyzed patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who were eligible for ARNI prescription (ejection fraction≤40%, no contraindications) and hospitalized from October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016. We used logistic regression to estimate the associations between hospital characteristics and patient ARNI prescription at hospital discharge, accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals using generalized estimating equation methods and adjusting for patient-level covariates. Of 16 674 eligible hospitalizations from 210 hospitals, 1020 patients (6.1%) were prescribed ARNI at discharge. The median hospital-level proportion of patients prescribed ARNI was 3.3% (Q1, Q3: 0%, 12.6%). After adjustment for patient-level covariates, for-profit hospitals had significantly higher odds of ARNI prescription compared with not-for-profit hospitals (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI , 1.05-6.10; P=0.04), and hospitals located in the Western United States had lower odds of ARNI prescription compared with those in the Northeast (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI , 0.13-0.84; P=0.02). Conclusions Relatively few hospital characteristics were associated with ARNI prescription at hospital discharge, in contrast to what has been observed in early adoption in other disease areas.
