Regenerative medicine relies mainly on the therapeutic potential of stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their immunosuppressive properties and tissue repair abilities, seem to be an ideal tool for cell-based therapies. Taking into account all available sources of MSCs, perinatal tissues become an attractive source of allogeneic MSCs. The allogeneic MSCs provide "off-the-shelf" cellular therapy, however, their allogenicity may be viewed as a limitation for their use. Moreover, some evidence suggests that MSCs are not as immune-privileged as it was previously reported. Therefore, understanding their interactions with the recipient's immune system is crucial for their successful clinical application. In this review, we discuss both autologous and allogeneic application of MSCs, focusing on current approaches to allogeneic MSCs therapies, with a particular interest in the role of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and HLA-matching in allogeneic MSCs transplantation. Importantly, the evidence from the currently completed and ongoing clinical trials demonstrates that allogeneic MSCs transplantation is safe and seems to cause no major side-effects to the patient. These findings strongly support the case for MSCs efficacy in treatment of a variety of diseases and their use as an "off-the-shelf" medical product.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766164">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unmodified autologous stem cells at point of care for chronic myocardial infarction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Numerous studies investigated cell-based therapies for myocardial infarction (MI). The conflicting results of these studies have established the need for developing innovative approaches for applying cell-based therapy for MI. Experimental studies on animal models demonstrated the potential of fresh, uncultured, unmodified, autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (UA-ADRCs) for treating acute MI. In contrast, studies on the treatment of chronic MI (CMI; > 4 wk post-MI) with UA-ADRCs have not been published so far. Among several methods for delivering cells to the myocardium, retrograde delivery into a temporarily blocked coronary vein has recently been demonstrated as an effective option.
AIM: To test the hypothesis that in experimentally-induced chronic myocardial infarction (CMI; > 4 wk post-MI) in pigs, retrograde delivery of fresh, uncultured, unmodified, autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (UA-ADRCs) into a temporarily blocked coronary vein improves cardiac function and structure.
METHODS: The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery of pigs was blocked for 180 min at time point T0. Then, either 18 × 10
RESULTS: Unlike the delivery of saline, delivery of UA-ADRCs demonstrated statistically significant improvements in cardiac function and structure at T2 compared to T1 (all values given as mean ± SE): Increased mean LVEF (UA-ADRCs group: 34.3% ± 2.9% at T1 
CONCLUSION: Retrograde cell delivery of UA-ADRCs in a porcine model for the study of CMI significantly improved myocardial function, increased myocardial mass and reduced the formation of scar tissue.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692971">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Intravascular Stem Cell Bioreactor for Prevention of Adverse Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background Prevention of adverse remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is an important goal of stem cell therapy. Clinical trial results vary, however, and poor cell retention and survival after delivery likely limit the opportunity to exert beneficial effects. To overcome these limitations, we built an implantable intravascular bioreactor (IBR) designed to protect contained cells from washout, dilution, and immune attack while allowing sustained release of beneficial paracrine factors. Methods and Results IBRs were constructed using semipermeable membrane adhered to a clinical-grade catheter shaft. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) viability in and paracrine factor release from IBRs were assessed in vitro and IBR biocompatibility and immune protection confirmed in vivo. In a porcine anterior MI model, IBRs containing 25 million allogeneic MSCs (IBR-MSCs) were compared with IBRs containing media alone (IBR-Placebo; n=8 per group) with adverse remodeling assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Four weeks after MI, IBR-MSCs had no significant change in end-diastolic volume (+0.33±4.32 mL; P=0.89), end-systolic volume (+2.14±4.13 mL; P=0.21), and left ventricular ejection fraction (-2.27±2.94; P=0.33) while IBR-Placebo had significant increases in end-diastolic volume (+10.37±3.84 mL; P=0.01) and ESV (+11.35±2.88 mL; P=0.01), and a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (-5.78±1.70; P=0.025). Eight weeks after MI, adherent pericarditis was present in 0 of 8 IBR-MSCs versus 4 of 8 IBR-Placebo (P=0.02), suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. In a separate study, 25 million allogeneic pig MSCs directly injected in the peri-infarct zone 3 days after MI (n=6) showed no significant benefit in adverse remodeling at 4 weeks compared with IBR-MSCs. Conclusions MSCs deployed inside an implantable, removable, and potentially rechargeable bioreactor in a large animal model remain viable, are immunoprotected, and attenuate adverse remodeling 4 weeks after MI.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-25<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340693">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A general practitioner's guide to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (hsct) is a medical procedure that consists of infusing stem cells after a short course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both. It can be used in the treatment of various cancers, as well as some benign conditions. In the present review, we discuss the various types of hsct and their main indications. The principles of the transplant procedure itself and the basics of recipient selection are reviewed. Special attention is given to both the immediate and the long-term complications of hsct and their management strategies. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is a potentially life-saving procedure and often the only curative option for a variety of diseases; however, it is not without significant toxicities.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285665">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> E-Posters.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211024">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Technology forecast: advanced therapies in late clinical research, EMA approval or clinical application via hospital exemption.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069029">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Combination chemotherapy plus dasatinib leads to comparable overall survival and relapse-free survival rates as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The Philadelphia chromosome is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been regarded as a favorable treatment option in adult Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL, its benefit is less clear in the era of newer generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like dasatinib.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study that analyzed the outcomes of adult patients with Ph+ ALL treated with either combination chemotherapy plus dasatinib or combination chemotherapy plus dasatinib followed by allogeneic HSCT.
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were included; 30 (42.9%) underwent allogeneic HSCT while 40 (57.1%) received only chemotherapy plus dasatinib. In comparing overall survival (OS) rates, results between the 2 groups were similar with a 1-year OS of 93.3% versus 100% (P = 0.20), 2-year OS of 89.8% versus 86.2% (P = 0.72), and 3-year OS of 76% versus 71.3% (P = 0.56) in the transplant versus nontransplant groups, respectively. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were also similar at 70.5% in the transplant group and 80.1% in the nontransplant group (P = 0.94). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with specific poor prognostic factors (higher white blood count, older age, positive minimal residual disease status), but results again showed no significant survival difference between transplant and nontransplant patients.
CONCLUSIONS: While HSCT has historically led to a survival advantage in Ph+ ALL, the results of our study demonstrate that it may have a less beneficial role in the era of newer generation TKIs such as dasatinib.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-04-24<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016870">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Delivery of oncolytic vaccinia virus by matched allogeneic stem cells overcomes critical innate and adaptive immune barriers.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified IFNγ as an important early barrier to oncolytic viruses including vaccinia. The existing innate and adaptive immune barriers restricting oncolytic virotherapy, however, can be overcome using autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells as carrier cells with unique immunosuppressive properties.
METHODS: To test the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to overcome innate and adaptive immune barriers and to successfully deliver oncolytic vaccinia virus to tumor cells, we performed flow cytometry and virus plaque assay analysis of ex vivo co-cultures of stem cells infected with vaccinia virus in the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Comparative analysis was performed to establish statistically significant correlations and to evaluate the effect of stem cells on the activity of key immune cell populations.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have the potential to eradicate resistant tumor cells through a combination of potent virus amplification and sensitization of the tumor cells to virus infection. Moreover, the ADSCs demonstrate ability to function as a virus-amplifying Trojan horse in the presence of both autologous and allogeneic human PBMCs, which can be linked to the intrinsic immunosuppressive properties of stem cells and their unique potential to overcome innate and adaptive immune barriers. The clinical application of ready-to-use ex vivo expanded allogeneic stem cell lines, however, appears significantly restricted by patient-specific allogeneic differences associated with the induction of potent anti-stem cell cytotoxic and IFNγ responses. These allogeneic responses originate from both innate (NK)- and adaptive (T)- immune cells and might compromise therapeutic efficacy through direct elimination of the stem cells or the induction of an anti-viral state, which can block the potential of the Trojan horse to amplify and deliver vaccinia virus to the tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings and data indicate the feasibility to establish simple and informative assays that capture critically important patient-specific differences in the immune responses to the virus and stem cells, which allows for proper patient-stem cell matching and enables the effective use of off-the-shelf allogeneic cell-based delivery platforms, thus providing a more practical and commercially viable alternative to the autologous stem cell approach.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917829">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Compositions and methods to inhibit stem cell and progenitor cell binding to lymphoid tissue and for regenerating germinal centers in lymphatic tissues<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present invention relates to compositions and methods of inhibiting stem cell binding to organs and tissues, including the blocking of stem cell binding to germinal centers present in lymph tissue.
