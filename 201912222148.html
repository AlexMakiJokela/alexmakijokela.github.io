The ability to modify selectively specific genes provides a powerful tool for characterizing gene functions, performing gene therapy, correcting specific genetic mutations, eradicating diseases, engineering cells and organisms to achieve new and different functions and obtaining transgenic animals as models for studying specific diseases. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology has recently revolutionized genome engineering. The application of this new technology to stem cell research allows disease models to be developed to explore new therapeutic tools. The possibility of translating new systems of molecular knowledge to clinical research is particularly appealing for addressing degenerative diseases. In this review, we describe several applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to stem cells related to degenerative diseases. In addition, we address the challenges and future perspectives regarding the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as an important technology in the medical sciences.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768221">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunoresponse to Gene-Modified Hematopoietic Stem Cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Gene transfer to and correction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are ideal strategies to cure a number of congenital and acquired disorders. However, transgene products may trigger immunological rejection of modified cells, limiting their therapeutic benefits. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI) allows for efficient engraftment and tolerance to gene-modified HSCs. In contrast, myeloablative chemotherapy using busulfan or similar agents is only sufficient to induce tolerance to gene-modified HSCs producing no or non-immunogenic protein. If cells are modified to produce a protein that is xenogenic or congenitally absent in the patient, additional immunosuppression may be required to prevent an immunological reaction to the transduced cells.

The advent of efficient virus-based methods for delivering therapeutic genes has enabled the development of genetic medicines for inherited disorders of the immune system, hemoglobinopathies, and a number of devastating metabolic diseases. Here, we briefly review the state of the art in the field, including gene editing approaches. A growing number of pediatric diseases can be successfully cured by hematopoietic stem-cell-based gene therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31737588">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Delivery methods and compositions for nuclease-mediated genome engineering<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present disclosure is in the field of genome engineering, particularly targeted modification of the genome of a cell.<br><b>Publication date:</b> December 3, 2019<br><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=(((%22hematopoietic+stem+cells%22+AND+CRISPR)+AND+AAV)+AND+(%22sickle+cell+disease%22+OR+%22beta+thalassemia%22))&OS="hematopoietic+stem+cells"+AND+CRISPR+AND+AAV+AND+("sickle+cell+disease"+OR+"beta+thalassemia")&RS=((("hematopoietic+stem+cells"+AND+CRISPR)+AND+AAV)+AND+("sickle+cell+disease"+OR+"beta+thalassemia"))">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Crispr enzyme mutations reducing off-target effects<br><b>Abstract:</b> Disclosed and claimed are mutation(s) or modification(s) of the CRISPR enzyme, for example a Cas enzyme such as a Cas9, which obtain an improvement, for instance a reduction, as to off-target effects of a CRISPR-Cas or CRISPR-enzyme or CRISPR-Cas9 system or complex containing or including such a mutated or modified Cas or CRISPR enzyme or Cas9.
