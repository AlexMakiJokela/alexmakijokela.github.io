CRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary technology that allows for precise, directed changes to genomic DNA. Our multi-disciplinary team of world-class researchers and drug developers is working to translate this technology into breakthrough human therapeutics in a number of serious diseases. Our lead programs in beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease have advanced to IND/CTA-enabling studies with a CTA filing planned by the end of 2017, and we are advancing additional programs in ex vivo and in vivo disease areas. In addition to our fully-owned programs, our strategic collaborations with Bayer AG and Vertex Pharmaceuticals expand our portfolio and enable us with unique capabilities. Through our private financings, partnerships, and IPO we have raised >$400M to fund and accelerate our portfolio. We have licensed the foundational CRISPR/Cas9 patent estate for human therapeutic use from our scientific founder, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier, who co-invented the application of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing. Our company is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland with R&D operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA and some business operations in London, United Kingdom.<br><b>Specialties:</b> Gene Editing, AAV, Hematology, and Immuno-Oncology<br><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/crispr-therapeutics/about/">LinkedIn Profile</a></b><br><b><a href="http://www.crisprtx.com">Website</a></b><br><br><b>Company Name:</b> Orchard Therapeutics<br><b>Overview:</b> Orchard Therapeutics is a leading global fully integrated commercial-stage company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients with rare diseases through innovative gene therapies.
