However, other aspects of the disease, especially inflammation, are less effectively treated by these drugs. We hypothesized that small molecule drugs could function either alone or as an adjuvant to licensed therapies to treat these aspects of the disease, perhaps emulating the effects of gene therapy in CF cells. The cardiac glycoside digitoxin, which has been shown to inhibit TNFα/NFκB signaling in CF lung epithelial cells, may serve as such a therapy.
METHODS: IB3-1 CF lung epithelial cells were treated with different Vertex (VX) drugs, digitoxin, and various drug mixtures, and ELISA assays were used to assess suppression of baseline and TNFα-activated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional responses to these drugs were assessed by RNA-seq and compared with gene expression in AAV-[wildtype]CFTR-treated IB3-1 (S9) cells. We also compared in vitro gene expression signatures with in vivo data from biopsied nasal epithelial cells from digitoxin-treated CF patients.
RESULTS: CF cells exposed to digitoxin exhibited significant suppression of both TNFα/NFκB signaling and downstream secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and GM-CSF, with or without co-treatment with VX drugs. No evidence of drug-drug interference was observed. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene therapy-treated CF lung cells induced changes in 3134 genes. Among these, 32.6% were altered by digitoxin treatment in the same direction. Shared functional gene ontology themes for genes suppressed by both digitoxin and gene therapy included inflammation (84 gene signature), and cell-cell interactions and fibrosis (49 gene signature), while genes elevated by both were enriched for epithelial differentiation (82 gene signature). A new analysis of mRNA data from digitoxin-treated CF patients showed consistent trends in expression for genes in these signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant gene therapy-emulating activities of digitoxin may contribute to enhancing the efficacy of currently licensed correctors and potentiators in CF patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Q Yang, A R Soltis, G Sukumar, X Zhang, H Caohuy, J Freedy, C L Dalgard, M D Wilkerson, H B Pollard, B S Pollard<br><b>Journal:</b> Respir.

However, cells of the innate immune system can also sense their local microenvironment and respond to physiological fluctuations in temperature, pH, oxygen and nutrient availability, which are altered during inflammation. Although cells of the immune system experience force and pressure throughout their life cycle, little is known about how these mechanical processes regulate the immune response. Here we show that cyclical hydrostatic pressure, similar to that experienced by immune cells in the lung, initiates an inflammatory response via the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1. Mice lacking PIEZO1 in innate immune cells showed ablated pulmonary inflammation in the context of bacterial infection or fibrotic autoinflammation. Our results reveal an environmental sensory axis that stimulates innate immune cells to mount an inflammatory response, and demonstrate a physiological role for PIEZO1 and mechanosensation in immunity.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Angel G Solis, Piotr Bielecki, Holly R Steach, Lokesh Sharma, Christian C D Harman, Sanguk Yun, Marcel R de Zoete, James N Warnock, S D Filip To, Autumn G York, Matthias Mack, Martin A Schwartz, Charles S Dela Cruz, Noah W Palm, Ruaidhrí Jackson, Richard A Flavell<br><b>Journal:</b> Nature<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1476-4687<br><b>Relevance score:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 24.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 16.345<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435009">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Recommendations for the collection and use of multiplexed functional data for clinical variant interpretation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Variants of uncertain significance represent a massive challenge to medical genetics. Multiplexed functional assays, in which the functional effects of thousands of genomic variants are assessed simultaneously, are increasingly generating data that can be used as additional evidence for or against variant pathogenicity. Such assays have the potential to resolve variants of uncertain significance, thereby increasing the clinical utility of genomic testing. Existing standards from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) and new guidelines from the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) establish the role of functional data in variant interpretation, but do not address the specific challenges or advantages of using functional data derived from multiplexed assays. Here, we build on these existing guidelines to provide recommendations to experimentalists for the production and reporting of multiplexed functional data and to clinicians for the evaluation and use of such data. By following these recommendations, experimentalists can produce transparent, complete, and well-validated datasets that are primed for clinical uptake. Our recommendations to clinicians and diagnostic labs on how to evaluate the quality of multiplexed functional datasets, and how different datasets could be incorporated into the ACMG/AMP variant-interpretation framework, will hopefully clarify whether and how such data should be used. The recommendations that we provide are designed to enhance the quality and utility of multiplexed functional data, and to promote their judicious use.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Gelman, Jennifer N Dines, Jonathan Berg, Alice H Berger, Sarah Brnich, Fuki M Hisama, Richard G James, Alan F Rubin, Jay Shendure, Brian Shirts, Douglas M Fowler, Lea M Starita, None None<br><b>Journal:</b> Genome Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-994X<br><b>Relevance score:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 10.47<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.084<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862013">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> An Intriguing Involvement of Mitochondria in Cystic Fibrosis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cystic fibrosis (CF) occurs when the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is not synthetized and folded correctly. The CFTR protein helps to maintain the balance of salt and water on many body surfaces, such as the lung surface. When the protein is not working correctly, chloride becomes trapped in cells, then water cannot hydrate the cellular surface and the mucus covering the cells becomes thick and sticky. Furthermore, a defective CFTR appears to produce a redox imbalance in epithelial cells and extracellular fluids and to cause an abnormal generation of reactive oxygen species: as a consequence, oxidative stress has been implicated as a causative factor in the aetiology of the process. Moreover, massive evidences show that defective CFTR gives rise to extracellular GSH level decrease and elevated glucose concentrations in airway surface liquid (ASL), thus encouraging lung infection by pathogens in the CF advancement. Recent research in progress aims to rediscover a possible role of mitochondria in CF. Here the latest new and recent studies on mitochondrial bioenergetics are collected. Surprisingly, they have enabled us to ascertain that mitochondria have a leading role in opposing the high ASL glucose level as well as oxidative stress in CF.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-08<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria Favia, Lidia de Bari, Antonella Bobba, Anna Atlante<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Relevance score:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698802">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Scope for Thalassemia Gene Therapy by Disruption of Aberrant Regulatory Elements.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The common IVSI-110 (G>A) β-thalassemia mutation is a paradigm for intronic disease-causing mutations and their functional repair by non-homologous end joining-mediated disruption.
