Arterial and venous cerebral blood flows interact with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the both the cranial and spinal systems. Studies suggest that increased blood and CSF flow pulsatility plays an important role in certain neurological diseases. Here, we investigated the changes in blood-CSF flow pulsatility in the cranial and spinal systems with age as well as the impact of the intracranial compartment on flow patterns.
METHOD: Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) was performed in 16 young and 19 elderly healthy volunteers to measure the flows of CSF and blood. CSF stroke volume (SV), blood SV, and arterial and venous pulsatility indexes (PIs) were assessed at intra- and extracranial levels in both samples. Correlations between ventricular and spinal CSF flow, and between blood and CSF flow during aging were also assessed.
RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in arterial cerebral blood flow and intracranial venous cerebral blood flow with aging. We also found a significant increase of intracranial blood SV, spinal CSF SV and arterial/venous pulsatility indexes with aging. In regard to intracranial compartment impact, arterial and venous PIs decreased significantly at intracranial level in elderly volunteers, while young adults exhibited decrease in venous PI only. Intracranial venous PI was paradoxically lower than extracranial venous PI, regardless of age. In both sample groups, spinal CSF SV and aqueductal CSF SV were positively correlated, and so were extracranial blood and spinal CSF SVs.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that aging changes blood flow but preserves blood and CSF interactions. We also showed that many parameters related to blood and CSF flows differ between young and elderly adults.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Armelle Lokossou, Serge Metanbou, Catherine Gondry-Jouet, Olivier Balédent<br><b>Journal:</b> Fluids Barriers CNS<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-8118<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.02<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.394<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931818">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Hand grip strength variability during serial testing as an entropic biomarker of aging: a Poincaré plot analysis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The Poincaré plot method can be used for both qualitative and quantitative assessment of self-similarity in usually periodic functions, hence the idea of applying it to the study of homeostasis of living organisms. From the analysis of numerous scientific data, it can be concluded that hand functionality can be correlated with the state of the human body as a biological system exposed to various forms of ontogenetic stress.
METHODS: We used the Poincaré plot method to analyze the variability of hand grip strength (HGS), as an entropic biomarker of aging, during 60 repetitive tests of the dominant and nondominant hand, in young and older healthy subjects. An observational cross-sectional study was performed on 80 young adults (18-22 years old, mean age 20.01 years) and 80 older people (65-69 years old, mean age 67.13 years), with a sex ratio of 1:1 for both groups. For statistical analysis, we applied univariate descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U-test for independent large samples, with the determination of the effect size coefficient r, and simple linear regression. We calculated the effect of fatigue and the Poincaré indices SD
RESULTS: The analysis of the differences between groups revealed statistically significant results for most HGS-derived indices (p ≤ 0.05), and the magnitude of the differences indicated, in most situations, a large effect size (r > 0.5). Our results demonstrate that the proposed repetitive HGS testing indicates relevant differences between young and older healthy subjects. Through the mathematical modeling of data and the application of the concept of entropy, we provide arguments supporting this new design of HGS testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the variability of HGS during serial testing, which reflects complex repetitive biomechanical functions, represents an efficient indicator for differentiation between young and older hand function patterns from an entropic perspective. In practical terms, the variability of HGS, evaluated by the new serial testing design, can be considered an attractive and relatively simple biomarker to use for gerontological studies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Elena Ioana Iconaru, Constantin Ciucurel<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Geriatr<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2318<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.02<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.352<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931730">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Assessment of cellular cobalamin metabolism in Gaucher disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic mutations in the GBA1 gene that encodes beta-glucosidase (GCase), and more rarely, by a deficiency in the GCase activator, saposin C. Clinically, GD manifests with heterogeneous multiorgan involvement mainly affecting hematological, hepatic and neurological axes. This disorder is divided into three types, based on the absence (type I) or presence and severity (types II and III) of involvement of the central nervous system. At the cellular level, deficiency of GBA1 disturbs lysosomal storage with buildup of glucocerebroside. The consequences of disturbed lysosomal metabolism on biochemical pathways that require lysosomal processing are unknown. Abnormal systemic markers of cobalamin (Cbl, B
METHODS: Cultured skin fibroblasts from control humans (n = 3), from patients with GD types I (n = 1), II (n = 1) and III (n = 1) and an asymptomatic carrier of GD were examined for their GCase enzymatic activity and lysosomal compartment intactness. Control human and GD fibroblasts were cultured in growth medium with and without 500 nM hydroxocobalamin supplementation. Cellular cobalamin status was examined via determination of metabolomic markers in cell lysate (intracellular) and conditioned culture medium (extracellular). The presence of transcobalamin (TC) in whole cell lysates was examined by Western blot.
RESULTS: Cultured skin fibroblasts from GD patients exhibited reduced GCase activity compared to healthy individuals and an asymptomatic carrier of GD, demonstrating a preserved disease phenotype in this cell type. The concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy), methylmalonic acid (MMA), cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met) in GD cells were comparable to control levels, except in one patient with GD III. The response of these metabolomic markers to supplementation with hydroxocobalamin (HOCbl) yielded variable results. The content of transcobalamin in whole cell lysates was comparable in control human and GD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that cobalamin transport and cellular processing pathways are overall protected from lysosomal storage damage in GD fibroblasts.

AIM: To document the current practices of endocrinologists and urologists in the management of older men with low testosterone in Israel.
METHODS: A 20-question survey of the management of hypogonadism was sent to members of the Israel Endocrine Society and the Israeli Urology Association MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were interviewed about their practice in diagnostic workup, prescription habits and monitoring of testosterone therapy.
RESULTS: The response rate was low (range 8-12%). Significant differences were found between members of the 2 professional associations. Overall, endocrinologists take a more conservative approach to the diagnosis and initial workup, modes of treatment, and to concerns about the safety of testosterone therapy. A divergence from the published clinical guidelines was also noted in some aspects of the clinical practices in both groups.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Significant variances in the diagnosis and treatment approach of hypogonadism between endocrinologists and urologists, as well as divergences from clinical guidelines, may lead to misuse of testosterone therapy.
STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This is the first study undertaken in Israel among urologists and endocrinologists of this increasingly recognized health issue. In our country, these 2 groups of physicians comprise nearly all of the testosterone treatment providers. The limitation of this study is linked to bias of all surveys based on subjective reporting, the fact that it was performed in only 1 country, and that we did not control for the specific assay used to measure testosterone levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the need for the implementation of coordinated guidelines to facilitate the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of men who can benefit from testosterone therapy and to minimize the risks of this therapy.

Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), a crucial lipid in membrane dynamics, is known to be essential in this context. In addition to nutriments deprivation, autophagy is also triggered by fluid-flow induced shear stress in epithelial cells, and this specific autophagic response depends on primary cilium (PC) signaling and leads to cell size regulation. Here we report that PI3KC2α, required for ciliogenesis and PC functions, promotes the synthesis of a local pool of PI3P upon shear stress. We show that PI3KC2α depletion in cells subjected to shear stress abolishes ciliogenesis as well as the autophagy and related cell size regulation. We finally show that PI3KC2α and VPS34, the two main enzymes responsible for PI3P synthesis, have different roles during autophagy, depending on the type of cellular stress: while VPS34 is clearly required for starvation-induced autophagy, PI3KC2α participates only in shear stress-dependent autophagy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Asma Boukhalfa, Anna Chiara Nascimbeni, Damien Ramel, Nicolas Dupont, Emilio Hirsch, Stephanie Gayral, Muriel Laffargue, Patrice Codogno, Etienne Morel<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941925">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Circular RNAs in the tumour microenvironment.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) widely expressed in eukaryotic cells. Mounting evidence has highlighted circRNAs as critical regulators of various tumours. More importantly, circRNAs have been revealed to recruit and reprogram key components involved in the tumour microenvironment (TME), and mediate various signaling pathways, thus affecting tumourigenesis, angiogenesis, immune response, and metastatic progression. In this review, we briefly introduce the biogenesis, characteristics and classification of circRNAs, and describe various mechanistic models of circRNAs. Further, we provide the first systematic overview of the interplay between circRNAs and cellular/non-cellular counterparts of the TME and highlight the potential of circRNAs as prospective biomarkers or targets in cancer clinics. Finally, we discuss the biological mechanisms through which the circRNAs drive development of resistance, revealing the mystery of circRNAs in drug resistance of tumours.
SHORT CONCLUSION: Deep understanding the emerging role of circRNAs and their involvements in the TME may provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer patients. The combined targeting of circRNAs and co-activated components in the TME may achieve higher therapeutic efficiency and become a new mode of tumour therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghua Ma, You Shuai, Xiangyu Gao, Xianzi Wen, Jiafu Ji<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

ER-phagy can occur by macroautophagic and microautophagic mechanisms. While dedicated machinery for macro-ER-phagy has been discovered, the molecules and mechanisms mediating micro-ER-phagy remain unknown. Here, we first show that micro-ER-phagy in yeast involves the conversion of stacked cisternal ER into multilamellar ER whorls during microautophagic uptake into lysosomes. Second, we identify the conserved Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase complex and the ESCRT machinery as key components for micro-ER-phagy. Third, we demonstrate that macro- and micro-ER-phagy are parallel pathways with distinct molecular requirements. Finally, we provide evidence that the ESCRT machinery directly functions in scission of the lysosomal membrane to complete the microautophagic uptake of ER. These findings establish a framework for a mechanistic understanding of micro-ER-phagy and, thus, a comprehensive appreciation of the role of autophagy in ER homeostasis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b>Authors:</b> Jasmin A Schäfer, Julia P Schessner, Peter W Bircham, Takuma Tsuji, Charlotta Funaya, Oliver Pajonk, Katharina Schaeff, Giulia Ruffini, Dimitrios Papagiannidis, Michael Knop, Toyoshi Fujimoto, Sebastian Schuck<br><b>Journal:</b> EMBO J.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1460-2075<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 9.96<br><b>SJR:</b> 7.579<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31802527">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A straightforward approach for bioorthogonal labeling of proteins and organelles in live mammalian cells, using a short peptide tag.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: In the high-resolution microscopy era, genetic code expansion (GCE)-based bioorthogonal labeling offers an elegant way for direct labeling of proteins in live cells with fluorescent dyes. This labeling approach is currently not broadly used in live-cell applications, partly because it needs to be adjusted to the specific protein under study.
RESULTS: We present a generic, 14-residue long, N-terminal tag for GCE-based labeling of proteins in live mammalian cells. Using this tag, we generated a library of GCE-based organelle markers, demonstrating the applicability of the tag for labeling a plethora of proteins and organelles. Finally, we show that the HA epitope, used as a backbone in our tag, may be substituted with other epitopes and, in some cases, can be completely removed, reducing the tag length to 5 residues.

This study was to evaluate the effects of known pathogenic gene mutation and disease progression on the striatum- and hippocampus-related neural circuits, including frontostriatal and hippocampus-posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) pathways.
METHODS: A total of 102 healthy mutation non-carriers, 40 presymptomatic mutation carriers (PMC), and 30 symptomatic mutation carriers (SMC) of amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), or presenilin 2 gene, with T1 structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional MRI were included. Representative neural circuits and their key nodes were obtained, including bilateral caudate-rostral middle frontal gyrus (rMFG), putamen-rMFG, and hippocampus-PCC. Volumes, diffusion indices, and functional connectivity of circuits were compared between groups and correlated with neuropsychological and clinical measures.
RESULTS: In PMC, APP gene mutation carriers showed impaired diffusion indices of caudate-rMFG and putamen-rMFG circuits; PS1 gene mutation carriers showed increased fiber numbers of putamen-rMFG circuit. SMC showed increased diffusivity of the left hippocampus-PCC circuit and volume reduction of all regions as compared with PMC. Imaging measures especially axial diffusivity of the representative circuits were correlated with neuropsychological measures.
CONCLUSIONS: APP and PS1 gene mutations affect frontostriatal circuits in a different manner in familial Alzheimer's disease; disease progression primarily affects the structure of hippocampus-PCC circuit. The structural connectivity of both frontostriatal and hippocampus-PCC circuits is associated with general cognitive function. Such findings may provide further information about the imaging biomarkers for early identification and prognosis of familial Alzheimer's disease, and pave the way for early diagnosis, gene- or circuit-targeted treatment, and even prevention.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Meina Quan, Tan Zhao, Yi Tang, Ping Luo, Wei Wang, Qi Qin, Tingting Li, Qigeng Wang, Jiliang Fang, Jianping Jia<br><b>Journal:</b> Alzheimers Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1758-9193<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.26<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.404<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937364">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Physicians' brain drain - a gravity model of migration flows.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The past two decades have been marked by impressive growth in the migration of medical doctors. The medical profession is among the most mobile of highly skilled professions, particularly in Europe, and is also the sector that experiences the most serious labour shortages. However, surprisingly little is known about how medical doctors choose their destinations. In addition, the literature is scarce on the factors determining the sharp rise in the migration of doctors from Africa, Asia and Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and how the last economic crisis has shaped the migration flows of health professionals.
METHODS: We use the new module on health worker migration provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for 2000-2016 in order to examine the channels through which OECD countries attract foreign physicians from abroad. We estimate a gravity model using the Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood estimator.
RESULTS: Our results reveal that a lower unemployment rate, good remuneration of physicians, an aging population, and a high level of medical technology at the destination are among the main drivers of physicians' brain drain. Furthermore, an analysis of the mobility of medical doctors from a number of regions worldwide shows that individuals react differently on a country-wise basis to various determinants present in the destination countries. Physicians from African countries are particularly attracted to destination countries offering higher wages, and to those where the density of medical doctors is relatively low. Concurrently, a higher demand for healthcare services and better medical technology in the receiving country drives the inflow of medical doctors from Central and Eastern Europe, while Asian doctors seem to preferentially migrate to countries with better school systems.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the channels through which OECD countries attract foreign medical doctors from abroad. We find that, apart from dyadic factors, a lower unemployment rate, good remuneration of physicians, an aging population, and good medical infrastructure in the host country are among the main drivers of physicians' brain drain. Furthermore, we find that utility from migration to specific countries may be explained by the heterogeneity of origin countries.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Alina Botezat, Raul Ramos<br><b>Journal:</b> Global Health<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1744-8603<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.65<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.237<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937356">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A rare case of Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer that developed into an intestinal obstruction: a case report.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBV-MCU) is a new category of mature B-cell neoplasms. Ulcers occur in the oropharyngeal mucosa, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. The onset of EBV-MCU is suggested to be related to the decreased immunity of the patient, the causes of which include the use of immunosuppressive agents and aging. EBV-MCU may regress spontaneously and it often has a benign course after the dose reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppressive agents or during follow-up. Here, we report the case of a patient who required surgical resection for the intestinal obstruction arising from EBV-MCU.
CASE PRESENTATION: A Japanese elderly male visited our hospital with chief complaints of a palpable mass and dull pain in the left upper quadrant, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Although abdominal computed tomography and total colonoscopy (TCS) revealed a tumor with circumferential ulcer in the transverse colon, histopathological analysis of a biopsy specimen of this lesion showed only nonspecific inflammation. Because the tumor spontaneously regressed during the time he underwent tests to obtain a second opinion from another hospital, TCS was reperformed on the patient. TCS revealed that the tumor decreased in size and the inflammatory changes in the surrounding mucosa tended to improve; however, tightening of the surrounding mucosa due to scarring was observed. Another histopathological analysis of a biopsy specimen showed widespread erosion of the mucosa and the formation of granulation tissue with marked infiltration of various inflammatory cells into the mucosal tissue of the large intestine. Moreover, some of the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20-positive B cells were also positive for EBV-encoded small RNA-1, suggesting the possibility of EBV-MCU. Later, the tumor developed into an intestinal obstruction; thus, the transverse colon was resected. Histopathological analysis of the resected specimen demonstrated scattered Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg-like multinucleated large B cells in addition to EBER-1-positive cells. The patient was finally diagnosed as having EBV-MCU.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a case of EBV-MCU that developed into an intestinal obstruction requiring surgical resection. It is necessary to consider the possibility of EBV-MCU when examining an ulcerative or tumorous lesion in the gastrointestinal tract.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Nozomi Morita, Chiaki Okuse, Keigo Suetani, Hiroyasu Nakano, Tetsuya Hiraishi, Shinya Ishigooka, Shuzo Mori, Tsukasa Shimamura, Takeshi Asakura, Junki Koike, Fumio Itoh, Michihiro Suzuki<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Gastroenterol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-230X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.35<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.047<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931725">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Effects of cholesterol content on activity of P-glycoproteins and membrane physical state, and consequences for anthelmintic resistance in the nematode Haemonchus contortus.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Eukaryote plasma membranes protect cells from chemical attack. Xenobiotics, taken up through passive diffusion, accumulate in the membranes, where they are captured by transporters, among which P-glycoproteins (Pgps). In nematodes such as Haemonchus contortus, eggshells and cuticles provide additional protective barriers against xenobiotics. Little is known about the role of these structures in the transport of chemical molecules. Pgps, members of the ABC transporter family, are present in eggshells and cuticles. Changes in the activity of these proteins have also been correlated with alterations in lipids, such as cholesterol content, in eggshells. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. We show here that an experimental decrease in the cholesterol content of eggshells of Haemonchus contortus, with Methyl-beta-CycloDextrin (MβCD), results in an increase in membrane fluidity, favouring Pgp activity and leading to an increase in resistance to anthelmintics. This effect is modulated by the initial degree of anthelminthic resistance of the eggs. These results suggest that eggshell fluidity plays a major role in the modulation of Pgp activity. They confirm that Pgp activity is highly influenced by the local microenvironment, in particular sterols, as observed in some vertebrate models. Thus, eggshell barriers could play an active role in the transport of xenobiotics.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Mickaël Riou, Fabrice Guégnard, Yves Le Vern, Isabelle Grasseau, Christine Koch, Elisabeth Blesbois, Dominique Kerboeuf<br><b>Journal:</b> Parasite<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1776-1042<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.09<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.018<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31934848">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Brain Morphological Changes With Functional Deficit Associated With Sexual Arousal in Postmenopausal Women.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: We have not known how menopause synchronously influences brain morphology and function associated with visually stimulated sexual arousal in postmenopausal women.
AIM: This study used a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry to evaluate menopause-related brain morphological and functional changes in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Nineteen premenopausal women and 19 postmenopausal women underwent functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Brain function activity was measured while the subjects viewed an erotic video clip.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 2-sample t-test was used for cross-analysis of the 2 groups for comparison of gray matter volumes (corrected P < .05) and brain activation (uncorrected P < .01).
RESULTS: Our study revealed a relationship between sexual function and morphological changes in postmenopausal women. Compared with premenopausal women, the postmenopausal group showed significantly lower brain activations in the major parts of the limbic system and basal ganglia, including the parahippocampal gyrus, head of caudate nucleus, insula, putamen, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and globus pallidus, which are involved in sexual behavior and emotional responses. In morphometric analyses, postmenopausal women showed significantly decreased gray matter volumes of the insula, putamen, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate gyrus, most of which were associated with decreased functional activity during visual sexual arousal in postmenopausal women. In addition, the premenopausal group alone showed a positive correlation between the activity of the insula and the level of estradiol (Pearson correlation r = 0.588; P = .008).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an association between menopause-related brain function and morphological changes in postmenopausal women.

Indeed, these marital factors can be well planned and/or managed to achieve desirable outcomes; for instance, the legal age of marriage can be increased to 21 years. However, how this will reflect on women's sexuality should be clarified before any laws are changed.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of the age of marriage, number of children, educational level, duration of marriage, and aging with female sexual function among groups of Egyptian women.
METHODS: We analyzed the recorded sociodemographic data and scores of the 19-item Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) among 270 apparently healthy women aged 21-45 years. According to the studied variables, the data were divided into various subgroups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The sociodemographic data and scores of the FSFI.
RESULTS: Marriage, before or after 21 years, was not correlated with sexual function. FSFI scores were significantly lower among women with ≥3 children and women who had been married for ≥10 years. FSFI scores were significantly lowest in women with the lowest educational level and those aged ≥40 years.
CONCLUSION: It is important to ensure that people are equipped with accurate information. Sound knowledge can serve as the basis for informed decisions regarding the age of marriage and number of children desired.

These models predict the existence of a mechanostat that links strain induced by mechanical forces to skeletal remodeling. However, how the mechanostat influences bone remodeling remains elusive. Here, we find that Piezo1 deficiency in osteoblastic cells leads to loss of bone mass and spontaneous fractures with increased bone resorption. Furthermore, Piezo1-deficient mice are resistant to further bone loss and bone resorption induced by hind limb unloading, demonstrating that PIEZO1 can affect osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk in response to mechanical forces. At the mechanistic level, in response to mechanical loads, PIEZO1 in osteoblastic cells controls the YAP-dependent expression of type II and IX collagens. In turn, these collagen isoforms regulate osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our data identify PIEZO1 as the major skeletal mechanosensor that tunes bone homeostasis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Lijun Wang, Xiuling You, Sutada Lotinun, Lingli Zhang, Nan Wu, Weiguo Zou<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941964">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> lncRNA JPX/miR-33a-5p/Twist1 axis regulates tumorigenesis and metastasis of lung cancer by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and Twist1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination are well established, but the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Twist1-mediated signaling remains largely unknown.
METHODS: RT-qPCR and western blotting were conducted to detect the expression levels of lncRNA JPX and Twist1 in lung cancer cell lines and tissues. The impact of JPX on Twist1 expression, cell growth, invasion, apoptosis, and in vivo tumor growth were investigated in lung cancer cells by western blotting, rescue experiments, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and xenograft animal experiment.
RESULTS: We observed that lncRNA JPX was upregulated in lung cancer metastatic tissues and was closely correlated with tumor size and an advanced stage. Functionally, JPX promoted lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and facilitated lung tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, JPX upregulated Twist1 by competitively sponging miR-33a-5p and subsequently induced EMT and lung cancer cell invasion. Interestingly, JPX and Twist1 were coordinately upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells. Mechanically, the JPX/miR-33a-5p/Twist1 axis participated in EMT progression by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lncRNA JPX, a mediator of Twist1 signaling, could predispose lung cancer cells to metastasis and may serve as a potential target for targeted therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Jinchang Pan, Shuai Fang, Haihua Tian, Chengwei Zhou, Xiaodong Zhao, Hui Tian, Jinxian He, Weiyu Shen, Xiaodan Meng, Xiaofeng Jin, Zhaohui Gong<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

Impaired mitochondrial function is suspected to play a major role in PD. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism by which impaired LRRK2 activity contributes to PD pathology remains unclear. Here, we identified the role of LRRK2 in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial tethering, which is essential for mitochondrial bioenergetics. LRRK2 regulated the activities of E3 ubiquitin ligases MARCH5, MULAN, and Parkin via kinase-dependent protein-protein interactions. Kinase-active LRRK2(G2019S) dissociated from these ligases, leading to their PERK-mediated phosphorylation and activation, thereby increasing ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ER-mitochondrial tethering proteins. By contrast, kinase-dead LRRK2(D1994A)-bound ligases blocked PERK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of E3 ligases, thereby increasing the levels of ER-mitochondrial tethering proteins. Thus, the role of LRRK2 in the ER-mitochondrial interaction represents an important control point for cell fate and pathogenesis in PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Toshihiko Toyofuku, Yuki Okamoto, Takako Ishikawa, Shigemi Sasawatari, Atsushi Kumanogoh<br><b>Journal:</b> EMBO J.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1460-2075<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 9.96<br><b>SJR:</b> 7.579<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31821596">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> OCIAD1 contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by inducing mitochondria dysfunction, neuronal vulnerability and synaptic damages.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Hyperamyloidosis in the brain is known as the earliest neuropathological change and a unique etiological factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), while progressive neurodegeneration in certain vulnerable brain regions forms the basis of clinical syndromes. It is not clear how early hyperamyloidosis is implicated in progressive neurodegeneration and what factors contribute to the selective brain vulnerability in AD.
METHODS: Bioinformatics and experimental neurobiology methods were integrated to identify novel factors involved in the hyperamyloidosis-induced brain vulnerability in AD. We first examined neurodegeneration-specific gene signatures from sporadic AD patients and synaptic protein changes in young transgenic AD mice. Then, we systematically assessed the association of a top candidate gene with AD and investigated its mechanistic role in neurodegeneration.
FINDINGS: We identified the ovary-orientated protein OCIAD1 (Ovarian-Carcinoma-Immunoreactive-Antigen-Domain-Containing-1) as a neurodegeneration-associated factor for AD. Higher levels of OCIAD1, found in vulnerable brain areas and dystrophic neurites, were correlated with disease severity. Multiple early AD pathological events, particularly Aβ/GSK-3β signaling, elevate OCIAD1, which in turn interacts with BCL-2 to impair mitochondrial function and facilitates mitochondria-associated neuronal injury. Notably, elevated OCIAD1 by Aβ increases cell susceptibility to other AD pathological challenges.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that OCIAD1 contributes to neurodegeneration in AD by impairing mitochondria function, and subsequently leading to neuronal vulnerability, and synaptic damages.

The pathogenesis of MS involves both genetic susceptibility and exposure to distinct environmental risk factors. The gene x environment interaction is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics refers to a complex system that modifies gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The most studied epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation.

However, its expression, function and regulation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have not been revealed yet.
METHODS: The expression of MOB1 and lysine demethylase 2B (KDM2B) in PDAC and adjacent normal pancreas tissues were measured. Also, the underlying mechanisms of altered MOB1 expression and its impact on PDAC biology were investigated.
RESULTS: We revealed for the first time that MOB1 was decreased expression in PDAC and was a statistically significant independent predictor of poor survival, and restored expression of MOB1 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of PDAC cells. Further studies demonstrated that KDM2B directly bound to the promoter region of MOB1, and suppressed the promoter activity of MOB1 and transcriptionally inhibited the MOB1 expression. Furthermore, KDM2B regulated Hippo pathway and promoted PDAC proliferation, migration and invasion via MOB1.

Glucose metabolism is the main pattern of energy supply in cells and its dysfunction is closely related to tumorigenesis. Recent study shows that KDM4B protects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction. We realized the significant role of KDM4B in metabolism. However, the role of KDM4B in glucose metabolism remains unclear. Here, we sought to delineate the role and mechanism of KDM4B in glucose metabolism in colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We first analyzed the role of KDM4B in glucose uptake and CRC growth. We then investigated the consequences of KDM4B inhibition on the expression of GLUT1 and AKT signaling, also explored the underlying mechanism. Finally, we detected the mechanism in vivo and assessed the potential correlation between the expression of KDM4B and CRC prognosis.
RESULTS: We found that KDM4B promoted glucose uptake and ATP production by regulating the expression of GLUT1 via the AKT signaling pathway. KDM4B could interact with TRAF6 and promote TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of AKT for AKT activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that KDM4B was overexpressed in CRC specimens and high level of KDM4B was associated with a poor survival rate in CRC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that KDM4B plays an important role in promoting CRC progression by enhancing glucose metabolism.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Haijie Li, Jingqin Lan, Guihua Wang, Kaixuan Guo, Caishun Han, Xiaolan Li, Junbo Hu, Zhixin Cao, Xuelai Luo<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

Familial PD is caused by mutations in several genes with diverse and mostly unknown functions. It is unclear how dysregulation of these genes results in the relatively selective death of nigral dopaminergic neurons (DNs). To address this question, we modeled PD by knocking out the PD genes PARKIN (PRKN), DJ-1 (PARK7), and ATP13A2 (PARK9) in independent isogenic human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines. We found increased levels of oxidative stress in all PD lines. Increased death of DNs upon differentiation was found only in the PARKIN knockout line. Using quantitative proteomics, we observed dysregulation of mitochondrial and lysosomal function in all of the lines, as well as common and distinct molecular defects caused by the different PD genes.

Mouse skin and hair follicle SCs (HFSCs) display reduced histone H3 K4me3, K9me3, and K27me3 methylation levels (hypomethylation) preceding hair growth. Chemical inhibition of relevant histone demethylases impairs subsequent differentiation and growth of HFs and delays wound healing. In wounding, this impairs epithelial cell differentiation and blood vessel recruitment, but not proliferation and fibroblast recruitment. With Aspm-CreER as a newfound inter-follicular epidermis lineage-labeling tool, and Lgr5-CreER for hair follicles, we demonstrate a reduced contribution of both lineages to wound healing after interfering with hypomethylation. Blocked hypomethylation increases BMP4 expression and selectively upregulates H3 K4me3 on the Bmp4 promoter, which may explain the effects on HFSC quiescence, hair cycle, and injury repair. Thus, transient hypomethylation of histone H3 K4/9/27me3 is essential for adult skin epithelial SC dynamics for proper tissue homeostasis and repair.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Sangjo Kang, Kylie Long, Sherry Wang, Aiko Sada, Tudorita Tumbar<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Reports<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2213-6711<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.60<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.698<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31866458">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> DNA hypermethylation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) caused by betel quid chewing-a possible predictive biomarker for malignant transformation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is observed in precancerous lesions and oral cancer of individuals with the habits of betel quid (BQ) chewing. SIRT1 has been identified as playing a role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity, and its alteration is often related to carcinogenesis. However, the methylation and transcription status of SIRT1 in patients with BQ chewing-related oral cancer has not been investigated. We examined the methylation status of SIRT1 in paraffin-embedded tissue samples of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) obtained from BQ chewing and non-chewing patients and in tissue samples from healthy control subjects. In addition, we examined whether the hypermethylation of SIRT1 followed by its transcriptional downregulation in the human gingival epithelial cells could be caused by arecoline, a major component of BQ. Furthermore, we investigated the methylation status of SIRT1 in smear samples of macroscopically healthy buccal mucosa from subjects with a habit of BQ chewing.
RESULTS: SIRT1 was significantly hypermethylated in tissue samples of OSCC from BQ chewers and non-chewers than in oral mucosa from healthy control subjects. Results also showed that the hypermethylation level of SIRT1 was significantly higher in OSCC of patients with BQ chewing habits than in those of non-chewing habits (p < 0.05). Our in vitro model showed that hypermethylation is followed by downregulation of the transcriptional level of SIRT1 (p < 0.05). The methylation levels of SIRT1 in the smear samples obtained from BQ chewing individuals were significantly higher than those in the samples obtained from individuals that did not chew BQ. The duration of BQ chewing habits was correlated positively to the frequency of SIRT1 hypermethylation (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DNA hypermethylation of SIRT1 is involved in the occurrence of oral cancer in BQ chewing patients and that hypermethylation in the oral mucosa of BQ chewers could be a predictive marker for the occurrence of malignant transformation. This is the first report that showed DNA hypermethylation in clinically healthy oral epithelium of BQ chewers.

Since oxidized proteins can be targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we investigated whether increased proteasome activity might affect the stress response in mice. Transgenic mice, expressing the N-terminally deleted version of α3 subunit (α3ΔN) of the proteasome, which has been shown to generate open-gated mutant proteasomes, in the forebrain were viable and fertile, but showed higher proteasome activity. After being challenged with CRS for 14 d, the mutant mice with hyperactive proteasomes showed significantly less immobility time in the forced swimming test compared with their wild-type littermates, suggesting that the α3ΔN transgenic mice are resistant to CRS. The accumulation of ER stress markers, such as polyubiquitin conjugates and phospho-IRE1α, was also significantly delayed in the hippocampus of the mutants. Notably, α3ΔN mice exhibited little deficits in other behavioral tasks, suggesting that stress resilience is likely due to the degradation of misfolded proteins by the open-gated proteasomes. These data strongly indicate that not only is the proteasome a critical modulator of stress response in vivo but also a possible therapeutic target for reducing chronic stress.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Ji Hyeon Kim, Ahbin Kim, Yejin Yun, Seoyoung Park, Jung Hoon Lee, Yong-Seok Lee, Min Jae Lee<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol Brain<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-6606<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.19<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.109<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931843">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Transcriptional analysis identifies potential biomarkers and molecular regulators in pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Lower respiratory infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rank among the most frequent causes of death worldwide. Improved diagnostics and profound pathophysiological insights are urgent clinical needs. In our cohort, we analysed transcriptional networks of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to identify central regulators and potential biomarkers. We investigated the mRNA- and miRNA-transcriptome of PBMCs of healthy subjects and patients suffering from CAP or AECOPD by microarray and Taqman Low Density Array. Genes that correlated with PBMC composition were eliminated, and remaining differentially expressed genes were grouped into modules. One selected module (120 genes) was particularly suitable to discriminate AECOPD and CAP and most notably contained a subset of five biologically relevant mRNAs that differentiated between CAP and AECOPD with an AUC of 86.1%. Likewise, we identified several microRNAs, e.g. miR-545-3p and miR-519c-3p, which separated AECOPD and CAP. We furthermore retrieved an integrated network of differentially regulated mRNAs and microRNAs and identified HNF4A, MCC and MUC1 as central network regulators or most important discriminatory markers. In summary, transcriptional analysis retrieved potential biomarkers and central molecular features of CAP and AECOPD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Wilhelm Bertrams, Kathrin Griss, Maria Han, Kerstin Seidel, Andreas Klemmer, Alexandra Sittka-Stark, Stefan Hippenstiel, Norbert Suttorp, Florian Finkernagel, Jochen Wilhelm, Timm Greulich, Claus F Vogelmeier, Julio Vera, Bernd Schmeck<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937830">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Does a novel exergame challenge balance and activate muscles more than existing off-the-shelf exergames?<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Novel balance-targeting exergames controlled with off-the-shelf hardware, were developed based on current recommendations for balance training in healthy older adults and documented shortcomings of existing games. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of these novel exergames as training tool for elderly and, more specifically whether these games can elicit more challenging weight shifts and higher levels of muscle activity compared to existing off-the-shelf exergames. Furthermore, the motivational pull in these new games was studied.
METHODS: Sixteen healthy older adults were recruited to play the novel games and two reference games that were found to be the most challenging ones in terms of weight shifts or muscle activity in previous studies. Weight shifts were expressed relative to participants' Functional Limits of Stability (FLOS). Muscular challenge of the games was quantified by dividing the signal into 200 ms blocks and determining the average muscle activity within these blocks. The muscle activity was normalized to maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) to categorize the blocks in zones of < 40, 40-60, 60-80 and > 80% MVC. Subsequently, the number of blocks per intensity level and the number of consecutive blocks above 40% were determined. Motivation to play the games was assessed using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) and scores between the games were analyzed using Generalized Estimated Equations (GEE).
RESULTS: The novel exergames successfully elicited center of mass (COM) displacements with medians of around 80% of FLOS or higher for all directions. Furthermore, the COM displacements in the novel games were larger for each direction than in the reference games, although for one game the sideward left direction reached significance only at the third trial. Compared to the existing games, longer blocks of muscle activation above 40% MVC were found, but overall intensity remained low. IMI scores were high on all subscales, indicating that older adults experienced the games as motivating.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that affordable hardware can be used to create challenging and enjoyable balance training programs using exergames. The exergames that were successful in eliciting challenging weight shifts and muscle activity should now be further studied in longitudinal randomized controlled interventions, to assess effects on balance, muscle strength and eventually fall risk in healthy older adults.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Jente Willaert, Aijse Willem De Vries, Julie Tavernier, Jaap H Van Dieen, Ilse Jonkers, Sabine Verschueren<br><b>Journal:</b> J Neuroeng Rehabil<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1743-0003<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.11<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.298<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941518">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Proteasome inhibition rapidly exacerbates photoinhibition and impedes recovery during high light stress in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Proteasomes remove regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells, and control a variety of plant processes. Proteasomes are localized to the cytosol and nuclear, but their role in plant biology has recently been extended to chloroplasts, where it regulates TOC complex. This is turn controls the import of nuclear-encoded chloroplastic proteins, which remodels the chloroplast proteome and facilitates proper developmental transitions. Proteasomal regulation of the TOC complex also alleviates stressors that generate reactive oxygen species. These recent advances motivated us to determine if proteasome inhibition rapidly alters photosynthetic processes stemming from photoinhibition induced by high light.
RESULTS: The short-term effects of proteasome inhibition on photosystem II during light stress was measured in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which allowed the dual monitoring of both chlorophyll fluorescence and cell viability. After 48 h at low light, proteasome inhibition did not affect viability or photochemistiry, but decreased cell concentration and increased cell volume. Two hours of high light stress impaired the efficiency of photosystem II in proteasome-inhibited cells, as determined by a decrease in Fv/Fm and the electron transport rate. Elevated photoinhibition in proteasome inhibited cells was not caused by a decrease in cell viability or chlorophyll content. Recovery from photoinhibition was attenuated in MG132-treated cells, and suppressed growth of a reestablished culture. Proteasome inhibition decreased de novo protein synthesis, which possibly constrained the ability to remodel the plastid proteome, and thus hampering the ability to adjust to high light stress.
CONCLUSION: The proteasome is implicated in protecting photosystem II from photoinhibition. In addition to high light stress, other stressors- including metals, drought, and salt- are also known to generate reactive oxygen species localized to the chloroplast. Therefore, proteasome maintenance in plants may help protect photosynthesis during abiotic stress, which could increase crop yield during adverse conditions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Mendoza, Carson Berry, Laura Prestigiacomo, Doug Van Hoewyk<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Plant Biol.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2229<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.687<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931713">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Latin American experience with a next generation sequencing genetic panel for recessive limb-girdle muscular weakness and Pompe disease.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a group of neuromuscular disorders of heterogeneous genetic etiology with more than 30 directly related genes. LGMD is characterized by progressive muscle weakness involving the shoulder and pelvic girdles. An important differential diagnosis among patients presenting with proximal muscle weakness (PMW) is late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a rare neuromuscular glycogen storage disorder, which often presents with early respiratory insufficiency in addition to PMW. Patients with PMW, with or without respiratory symptoms, were included in this study of Latin American patients to evaluate the profile of variants for the included genes related to LGMD recessive (R) and LOPD and the frequency of variants in each gene among this patient population.
RESULTS: Over 20 institutions across Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Chile) enrolled 2103 individuals during 2016 and 2017. Nine autosomal recessive LGMDs and Pompe disease were investigated in a 10-gene panel (ANO5, CAPN3, DYSF, FKRP, GAA, SGCA, SGCB, SGCD, SGCG, TCAP) based on reported disease frequency in Latin America. Sequencing was performed with Illumina's NextSeq500 and variants were classified according to ACMG guidelines; pathogenic and likely pathogenic were treated as one category (P) and variants of unknown significance (VUS) are described. Genetic variants were identified in 55.8% of patients, with 16% receiving a definitive molecular diagnosis; 39.8% had VUS. Nine patients were identified with Pompe disease.

Therefore, this study aims to explore: 1) the problems and needs experienced by healthcare professionals, volunteers and experts-by-experience (HCP/VE) during their work with patients with SUD in a palliative care trajectory and; 2) to make suggestions for improvements using the quality of care model by Donabedian (Structure, Process, Outcome).
METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted, consisting of six focus group interviews which consisted of HCP/VE working with patients with SUD in a palliative care phase. At the end of the focus group interviews, participants structured and summarized their experiences within a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework. Interview transcripts (other than the SWOT) were analysed by the researchers following procedures from the Grounded Theory Approach ('Grounded Theory Lite'). SWOT-findings were not subjected to in-depth analysis.
RESULTS: HCP/VE stated that within the Structure of care, care networks are fragmented and HCP/VE often lack knowledge about patients' multiplicity of problems and the time to unravel these. Communication with this patient group appears limited. The actual care-giving Process requires HCP/VE a lot of creativity and time spent seeking for cooperation with other caregivers and appropriate care settings. The latter is often hindered by stigma. Since no formalized knowledge is available, care-delivery is often exclusively experience-based. Pain-medication is often ineffective due to active substance use. Finally, several Outcomes were brought forward: Firstly, a palliative care phase is often identified only at a late stage. Secondly, education and a (mobile) team of expertise are desired. Thirdly, care for the caregivers themselves is often de-prioritized.
CONCLUSIONS: Better integration and collaboration between the different professionals with extensive experience in addiction, palliative and general curative care is imperative to assure good palliative care for patients with SUD. Currently, the resources for this care appear to be insufficient. Development of an educational program and social mapping may be the first steps in improving palliative care for patients with severe SUD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Anne Ebenau, Boukje Dijkstra, Chantal Ter Huurne, Jeroen Hasselaar, Kris Vissers, Marieke Groot<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Palliat Care<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1472-684X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.195<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937289">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Effects of fungal infection on the survival of parasitic bat flies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Parasites are able to alter numerous aspects of their hosts' life history, behaviour and distribution. One central question in parasitology is to determine the degree of impact that parasites have on their hosts. Laboulbeniales (Fungi: Ascomycota) are ectoparasitic fungi of arthropods. Even though these fungi are widely distributed, little is known about their ecology and their possible physiological effects on their hosts. We used a highly specific bat fly-fungi association to assess the effect of these fungal parasites on their dipteran hosts.
METHODS: We collected bat flies (Diptera: Nycteribiidae) belonging to two species, Nycteribia schmidlii and Penicillidia conspicua from their bat host Miniopterus schreibersii (Chiroptera: Miniopteridae). We experimentally tested the effect of infection on the lifespan of bat flies.
RESULTS: The prevalence of Laboulbeniales fungi was 17.9% in N. schmidlii and 64.8% in P. conspicua. Two fungi species were identified, Arthrorhynchus eucampsipodae and A. nycteribiae, both showing strict host specificity with N. schmidlii and P. conspicua, respectively. We found that fungal infection reduced by half the survival rate of P. conspicua regardless of sex, whereas N. schmidlii was not affected by the infection. Moreover, the intensity of infection showed negative correlation with the lifespan of P. conspicua.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first indication that fungal infection can alter bat fly survival and thus may play a significant role in the population dynamics of these bat ectoparasites.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Tamara Szentiványi, Péter Estók, Romain Pigeault, Philippe Christe, Olivier Glaizot<br><b>Journal:</b> Parasit Vectors<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-3305<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.565<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931866">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis: experience of a Mediterranean hospital.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis, considered by the World Health Organization as one of the most important tropical diseases, is endemic in the Mediterranean Basin. The aim of this study was to evaluate epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) in La Fe University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The particular focus was on diagnosis techniques and clinical differences according to the immunological status of the patients.
METHODS: An eleven-year retrospective observational study of CL and MCL episodes at the hospital was performed. Epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic variables of each case, together with the microbiological and anatomopathological diagnosis, were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included, 30 of them were male and 28 were immunocompetent. Most of the cases (36/42) were diagnosed in the last 5 years (2013-2017). The incidence of CL and MCL increased from 3.6/100,000 (2006-2012) to 13.58/100,000 (2013-2017). The majority of the patients (37/42) exhibited CL, in 30 cases as single lesions (30/37). Ulcerative lesions were more common in immunosuppressed patients (13/14) than in immunocompetent patients (20/28), (P = 0.2302). The length of lesion presence before diagnosis was 7.36 ± 6.72 months in immunocompetent patients and 8.79 ± 6.9 months in immunosuppressed patients (P = 0.1863). Leishmania DNA detection (92.3%) was the most sensitive diagnostic technique followed by Giemsa stain (65%) and histopathological examination (53.8%). Twelve patients (12/42) had close contact with dogs or were living near to kennels, and 10 of them did not present underlying conditions. Intralesional glucantime (21/42) and liposomal amphotericin B (7/42) were the most common treatments administered in monotherapy. All patients evolved successfully and no relapse was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Some interesting clinical and epidemiological differences were found in our series between immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Future studies can take these results further especially by studying patients with biological therapy. Skin biopsies combining NAAT with histological techniques are the most productive techniques for CL or MCL diagnosis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Marta Garrido-Jareño, Antonio Sahuquillo-Torralba, Rabab Chouman-Arcas, Iván Castro-Hernández, José Miguel Molina-Moreno, Margarita Llavador-Ros, María Dolores Gómez-Ruiz, José Luis López-Hontangas, Rafael Botella-Estrada, Miguel Salavert-Lleti, Javier Pemán-García<br><b>Journal:</b> Parasit Vectors<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-3305<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.565<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931865">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Clonorchis sinensis MF6p/HDM (CsMF6p/HDM) induces pro-inflammatory immune response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells via NF-κB-dependent MAPK pathways.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: MF6p/host defense molecules (HDMs) are a broad family of small proteins secreted by helminth parasites. Although the physiological role of MF6p/HDMs in trematode parasites is not fully understood, their potential biological function in maintaining heme homeostasis and modulating host immune response has been proposed.
METHODS: A gene encoding the MF6p/HDM of Clonorchis sinensis (CsMF6p/HDM) was cloned. Recombinant CsMF6p/HDM (rCsMF6p/HDM) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The biochemical and immunological properties of rCsMF6/HDM were analyzed. CsMF6p/HDM induced pro-inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 cells was analyzed by cytokine array assay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The structural feature of CsMF6p/HDM was analyzed by three-dimensional modeling and molecular docking simulations.
RESULTS: The CsMF6p/HDM shares a high level of amino acid sequence similarity with orthologs from other trematodes and is expressed in diverse developmental stages of the parasite. The rCsMF6p/HDM bound to bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), without effectively neutralizing LPS-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Rather, the rCsMF6p/HDM induced pro-inflammatory immune response, which is characterized by the expression of TNF-α and IL-6, in RAW 264.7 cells. The rCsMF6p/HDM-induced pro-inflammatory immune response was regulated by JNK and p38 MAPKs, and was effectively down-regulated via inhibition of NF-κB. The structural analysis of CsMF6p/HDM and the docking simulation with LPS suggested insufficient capture of LPS by CsMF6p/HDM, which suggested that rCsMF6p/HDM could not effectively neutralize LPS-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Although rCsMF6p/HDM binds to LPS, the binding affinity may not be sufficient to maintain a stable complex of rCsMF6p/HDM and LPS. Moreover, the rCsMF6p/HDM-induced pro-inflammatory response is characterized by the release of IL-6 and TNF-α in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The pro-inflammatory response induced by rCsMF6p/HDM is mediated via NF-κB-dependent MAPK signaling pathway. These results collectively suggest that CsMF6p/HDM mediates C. sinensis-induced inflammation cascades that eventually lead to hepatobiliary diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Jung-Mi Kang, Won Gi Yoo, Hương Giang Lê, Jinyoung Lee, Woon-Mok Sohn, Byoung-Kuk Na<br><b>Journal:</b> Parasit Vectors<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-3305<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.565<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931867">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Drug related problems in admitted geriatric patients: the impact of clinical pharmacist interventions.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Geriatric patients are at high risk of Drug Related Problems (DRPs) due to multi- morbidity associated polypharmacy, age related physiologic changes, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics alterations. These patients often excluded from premarketing trials that can further increase the occurrence of DRPs. This study aimed to identify drug related problems and determinants in geriatric patients admitted to medical and surgical wards, and to evaluate the impact of clinical pharmacist interventions for treatment optimization.
METHODS: A prospective interventional study was conducted among geriatric patients admitted to medical and surgical wards of Jimma University Medical Center from April to July 2017. Clinical pharmacists reviewed patients drug therapy, identified drug related problems and provided interventions. Data were analyzed by using SPSS statistical software version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were performed to determine the proportion of drug related problems. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the determinants of drug related problems.
RESULTS: A total of 200 geriatric patients were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 67.3 years (SD7.3). About 82% of the patients had at least one drug related problems. A total of 380 drug related problems were identified and 670 interventions were provided. For the clinical pharmacist interventions, the prescriber acceptance rate was 91.7%. Significant determinants for drug related problems were polypharmacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.350, 95% C.I: 1.212-9.260, p = 0.020) and number of comorbidities (AOR = 1.588, 95% C.I: 1.029-2.450, p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: Drug related problems were substantially high among geriatric inpatients. Patients with polypharmacy and co-morbidities had a much higher chance of developing DRPs. Hence, special attention is needed to prevent the occurrence of DRPs in these patients. Moreover, clinical pharmacists' intervention was found to reduce DRPs in geriatric inpatients.

Yet, few studies have evaluated whether changes in perceived neighborhood characteristics over time may be associated with cardiometabolic health indicators.
METHODS: Changes in perception of one's neighborhood (2013-2016) were determined from a cohort of residents who lived in one of two low-income urban neighborhoods. Changes were categorized into the following: improvement vs. no change or worsening over the three-year time-period. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between perceived improvement in each of the neighborhood characteristics with cardiometabolic outcomes (BMI, SBP, DBP, HbA1c, HDL-c) that were assessed in 2016, and compared with those who perceived no change or worsening of neighborhood characteristics. Models were adjusted for age, sex, income, education, marital status, physical function, neighborhood, and years spent in neighborhood. To examine potential sex differences, follow-up models were conducted and stratified by sex.
RESULTS: Among the 622 individuals who remained in the same neighborhood during the time period, 93% were African American, 80% were female, and the mean age was 58 years. In covariate-adjusted models, those who perceived improvement in their neighborhood safety over the time period had a significantly higher BMI (kg/m
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that perceived neighborhood characteristics may impact cardiometabolic outcomes (BMI, SBP), but through differing pathways.

Less well known is how gender mediates such differences. We conducted a population-based cohort study to describe associations between household and community-level income and rehospitalizations for types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus among Canadian women and men.
METHODS: Our cohorts were drawn from respondents to the 2006 mandatory long-form census linked longitudinally to 3 years of nationally standardized hospital records. We included adults 30-69 years hospitalized with diabetes at least once during the study period. We used logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios for 12-month diabetes rehospitalization associated with indicators of household and community-level income, with separate models by gender, and controlling for a range of other sociodemographic characteristics. Since diabetes may not always be recognized as the main reason for hospitalization, we accounted for disease progression through consideration of admissions where diabetes was previously identified as a secondary diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among persons hospitalized at least once with diabetes (n = 41,290), 1.5% were readmitted within 12 months where the initial admission had diabetes as the primary diagnosis, and 1.8% were readmitted where the initial admission had diabetes as a secondary diagnosis. For men, being in the lowest household income quintile was associated with higher odds of rehospitalization in cases where the initial admission listed diabetes as either the primary diagnosis (OR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.38-3.51) or a secondary diagnosis (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.02-2.24). For women, we found no association with income and rehospitalization, but having less than university education was associated with higher odds of rehospitalization where diabetes was a secondary diagnosis of the initial admission (OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.21-2.92). We also found positive, but insignificant associations between community-level poverty and odds of rehospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal health coverage remains insufficient to eliminate socioeconomic inequalities in preventable diabetes-related hospitalizations, as illustrated in this Canadian context. Decision-makers should tread cautiously with gender-blind poverty reduction actions aiming to enhance population health that may inadequately respond to the different needs of disadvantaged women and men with chronic illness.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Neeru Gupta, Dan L Crouse, Adele Balram<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Public Health<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2458<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.69<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.382<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937292">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Disease causing poverty: adapting the Onyx and Bullen social capital measurement tool for China.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Disease-causing poverty is a serious problem in rural China, where social capital can mediate the disease-poverty relationship. However, there is no generally accepted reliable, robust and viable measure of social capital for China's unique socio-cultural context. This study adapts for China the widely used Onyx and Bullen social capital measurement scale and tests the validity and reliability of a modified Chinese Onyx-Bullen general scale, the Chinese Onyx-Bullen health scale, for a disease-causing-poverty subpopulation in rural China.
METHODS: We conducted the forward and backward translation procedure and cross-cultural adaptation process to derive the 34 item Chinese Onyx-Bullen general scale. Next we collected through face-to face interviews a sample of disease-causing poverty population in rural Shandong province in China to test a 29 item modified Chinese Onyx-Bullen general scale for a health subpopulation. Most of the rural respondents had no formal work, so 5 work-related items in the Onyx-Bullen general scale were deleted in the Chinese Onyx-Bullen health scale. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the structure, validity, internal consistency and reliability of the Chinese Onyx-Bullen health scale. SPSS21.0 software was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 467 people completed the scale. For the 29-item scale, a better simple structure was found when the number of factors was limited to 8. The absolute values of inter-factor correlations were in the range of 0.004 to 0.213 and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.834. All the eight factors explain a total of 59.51% of the variance. The total scale had a Cronbach's alpha = 0.868, in which seven of the eight factors had Cronbach's α greater than 0.5.
CONCLUSION: The Chinese health version of the Onyx-Bullen general social capital scale showed an adequate reliability and validity in a rural disease-causing poverty subpopulation in Shandong province, providing the first general, robust, consistent and reliable measure of social capital in China. The Chinese Onyx-Bullen general social capital scale provides a scale for testing social capital in China or for modification along the lines of the Chinese Onyx-Bullen health scale.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Lizheng Xu, Min Guo, Stephen Nicholas, Long Sun, Fan Yang, Jian Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Public Health<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2458<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.69<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.382<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937283">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The relationship between blood lipids and plasma amyloid beta is depend on blood pressure: a population-based cross-sectional study.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: It is believed that deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain is the central pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which triggers a series of pathological processes.

In the latter stages of the war, inspired by Family Medicine programs in countries such as Canada, plans to rebuild a new system founded on a strong primary care model emerged. Over the next fifteen years, the Queen's University Family Medicine Development Program in Bosnia and Herzegovina played an instrumental role in rebuilding the primary care system through educational initiatives at the undergraduate, residency, Masters, PhD, and continuing professional development levels. Changes were supported by new laws and regulations to insure sustainability. This study revisited Bosnia and Herzegovina (B-H) 8-years after the end of the program to explore the impact of initiatives through understanding the perspectives and experiences of individuals at all levels of the primary care system from students, deans of medical schools, Family Medicine residents, practicing physicians, Health Center Directors and Association Leaders.
METHODS: Qualitative exploratory design using purposeful sampling. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key informants were conducted in English or with an interpreter as needed and audiotaped. Transcripts and field notes were analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological approach to identify major themes and subthemes.
RESULTS: Overall, 118 participants were interviewed. Three major themes and 9 subthemes were identified including (1) The Development of Family Medicine Education, (subthemes: establishment of departments of family medicine, undergraduate medical curriculum change), (2) Family Medicine as a Discipline (Family Medicine specialization, academic development, and Family Medicine Associations), and (3) Health Care System Issues (continuity of care, comprehensiveness of care, practice organization and health human resources).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impact of years of war and the challenges of a complex and unstable postwar environment, initiatives introduced by the Queen's Program succeeded in establishing sustainable changes, allowing Family Medicine in B-H to continue to adapt without abandoning its strong foundations. Despite the success of the program, the undervaluing of Primary Care from a human resource and health finance perspective presents ongoing threats to the system.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Geoffrey Hodgetts, Glenn Brown, Olivera Batić-Mujanović, Larisa Gavran, Zaim Jatić, Maja Račić, Gordana Tešanović, Amra Zahilić, Mary Martin, Richard Birtwhistle<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Fam Pract<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2296<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.52<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.332<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931726">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Downregulation of lncRNA DANCR promotes osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely known to have an appreciable effect in physiology and pathology. In tooth regeneration, periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are regarded as a key effector, whereas, how lncRNA acts in the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs have not been completely understood. This study aims to find out the relationship between lncRNA DANCR and the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs.
METHODS: Microarray was used to observe the different expression of lncRNAs in differentiated and undifferentiated PDLSCs. And then osteogenic-related lncRNA, DANCR was screened out. Its effects on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation was explored by constructing an overexpression and inhibition model. qRT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of osteogenesis related genes. MTT assay was performed to assess the effects of DANCR on cell growth curve. To quantify the effects of DANCR on osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs, ALP staining and alizarin red was performed in basic culture medium and osteogenic medium. Data were statistically processed.
RESULTS: Compared with the undifferentiated PDLSCs, the alizarin red staining level was higher in differentiated PDLSCs. And the expressions of osteogenic differentiation marker genes Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteocalcin (OCN) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) were significantly increased in the differentiated PDLSCs. Furthermore, we noticed that comparing with control groups, the expression of lncRNA DANCR decreases markedly in osteogenically induced PDLSCs. DANCR promoted proliferation of PDLSCs, as evidenced by cell viability. Further investigation has proven that the downregulation of DANCR shows in the calcium sediment forming, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activation and some osteogenic-related gene markers' upregulation including Runx2, OCN and BMP-2, which finally results in the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs following the transfection and induction. Conversely, DANCR upregulation was shown to repress the osteogenic differentiation potential of PDLSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: The osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs has proven to related to the down regulation of lncRNA DANCR. And this paper throws light on the effects of DANCR in the process of PDLSCs' osteogenic differentiation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Wang, Yuanliang Huang, Luanjun Tan<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Dev.

Multiple healthcare and service providers are often involved in care, which can result in increased risk of fragmentation of care. Optimal medication therapy management (MTM) is essential to ensure therapeutic benefit from medication regimens. However, little is known about the experiences of providers in supporting persons with SCI/D with MTM.
METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted to explore healthcare and service providers' experiences with MTM for persons with SCI/D. Participants were recruited through clinical organizations and researchers' personal contacts. Participants were purposefully selected for diversity in profession and were required to be English speaking and to have provided care to at least one person with SCI/D. The qualitative interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide. Data display matrices were used in a constant comparative process for descriptive and interpretive analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-two interviews were conducted from April to December 2018. Each profession had distinct views on their roles in facilitating MTM for persons with SCI/D, which aligned with their respective scopes of practice. Shared provider tasks included tailoring medications, providing education, and exploring medication alternatives. Most participants felt that the care they provided for persons with SCI/D was similar to the care that they provided to other patients, with some differences relating to the physical limitations and medical complexity associated with SCI/D. Five factors were identified that impacted participants' abilities to provide MTM for persons with SCI/D: patient self-management skills, provider knowledge and confidence, provider-patient relationships, interprofessional collaboration, and provider funding models including the use of technology-supported consultations.
CONCLUSION: While participants described commonalities in the barriers and enablers associated with providing MTM to persons with SCI/D and other populations, there were unique considerations identified. These SCI/D-specific considerations resulted in recommendations for improvements in MTM for this population. Future research should include perspectives from persons with SCI/D.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Sara J T Guilcher, Amanda C Everall, Tejal Patel, Tanya L Packer, Sander L Hitzig, Stephanie R Cimino, Aisha K Lofters<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Neurol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2377<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.35<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.078<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941437">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gated recurrent unit-based heart sound analysis for heart failure screening.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a type of cardiovascular disease caused by abnormal cardiac structure and function. Early screening of HF has important implication for treatment in a timely manner. Heart sound (HS) conveys relevant information related to HF; this study is therefore based on the analysis of HS signals. The objective is to develop an efficient tool to identify subjects of normal, HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction automatically.
METHODS: We proposed a novel HF screening framework based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in this study. The logistic regression-based hidden semi-Markov model was adopted to segment HS frames. Normalized frames were taken as the input of the proposed model which can automatically learn the deep features and complete the HF screening without de-nosing and hand-crafted feature extraction.
RESULTS: To evaluate the performance of proposed model, three methods are used for comparison. The results show that the GRU model gives a satisfactory performance with average accuracy of 98.82%, which is better than other comparison models.
CONCLUSION: The proposed GRU model can learn features from HS directly, which means it can be independent of expert knowledge. In addition, the good performance demonstrates the effectiveness of HS analysis for HF early screening.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Shan Gao, Yineng Zheng, Xingming Guo<br><b>Journal:</b> Biomed Eng Online<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1475-925X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.30<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.595<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931811">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pleural fluid ADA activity in tuberculous pleurisy can be low in elderly, critically ill patients with multi-organ failure.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity is typically elevated in patients with tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE), but low ADA has occasionally been reported in patients with TPE. The characteristics of these patients are not well-known, and erroneous exclusion of the possibility of TPE can result in a delayed diagnosis. This study investigated the characteristics of patients with TPE who had low ADA activity.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with microbiologically or pathologically confirmed TPE between 2012 to 2018 in a tertiary hospital in South Korea. Patients were categorised into two groups: high ADA (≥40 IU/L) and low ADA (< 40 IU/L). Clinical characteristics and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were compared between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients with TPE were included; 36 (18.8%) had ADA < 40 IU/L with a mean ADA activity level of 20.9 (±9.2) IU/L. Patients with low ADA were older (75.3 vs. 62.0 years, p < 0.001) and had a lower mean lymphocyte percentage (47.6% vs. 69.9%, p < 0.001) than patients with high ADA. Patients in the low ADA group had a significantly higher mean SOFA score (2.31 vs. 0.68, p < 0.001), and patients with organ dysfunction were significantly more common in the low ADA group (p < 0.001). Patients with 2 or ≥ 3 organ dysfunctions constituted 19.4 and 13.9% of the patients in the low ADA group, whereas they constituted 7.1 and 1.3% of the patients in the high ADA group (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that older age (odds ratio = 1.030, 95% confidence interval 1.002-1.060, p = 0.038) and a higher SOFA score (odds ratio = 1.598, 95% confidence interval 1.239-2.060, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with low ADA activity in patients with TPE.
CONCLUSIONS: ADA activity can be low in patients with TPE who are elderly, critically ill, and exhibit multiorgan failure. Low ADA activity cannot completely exclude the diagnosis of TPE, and physicians should exercise caution when interpreting pleural fluid exams.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Sae Byol Kim, Beomsu Shin, Ji-Ho Lee, Seok Jeong Lee, Myoung Kyu Lee, Won-Yeon Lee, Suk Joong Yong, Sang-Ha Kim<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Pulm Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2466<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.955<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937286">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> LncRNA CASC 2 is upregulated in aphthous stomatitis and predicts the recurrence.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common oral disease with unknown molecular pathogenesis. Our preliminary microarray analysis revealed the altered expression of lncRNA Cancer Susceptibility Gene 2 (CASC2) in RAS. We therefore analyzed the role of CASC2 in RAS.
METHODS: In this study, plasma samples were obtained from RAS patients and healthy participants. Plasma levels of CASC2 were measured by RT-qPCR. Plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-18 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A follow-up study was performed to analyze the role of CASC2 in the recurrence of RAS.
RESULTS: In the present study, we found that lncRNA Cancer Susceptibility Gene 2 (CASC2), as well as pro-inflammatory factors interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 18 (IL-18), were upregulated in plasma of RAS patients compared with healthy participants. Plasma levels of lncRNA CASC2 were positively correlated with plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-18 in RAS patients but not in healthy participants. Compared with pre-treatment levels, plasma levels of lncRNA CASC2, IL-6 and IL-18 were reduced after recovery.

A clinical case series.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: There is some limited evidence for the presence of viruses in herniated disc material including a previous case series that claimed to provide "unequivocal evidence of the presence of herpes virus DNA in intervertebral disc specimens of patients with lumbar disc herniation suggesting the potential role of herpes viruses as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of degenerative disc disease". This study has not been replicated. The objective of our study was to determine if viruses were present in herniated disc fragments in participants with a prior history of back pain.
METHODS: We recruited fifteen participants with a history of prior low-back pain prior to undergoing disc herniation surgery in the lumbar spine. Harvested disc samples were subject to next generation sequencing for detection of both RNA and DNA viral pathogens. Additionally, samples were analysed by a broadly reactive PCR targeting herpesviral DNA. Ethics approval was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committees of both Murdoch University, and St John of God Hospital, Western Australia.
RESULTS: Of the fifteen research participants, 8 were female. Mean age was 49.4 years (SD 14.5 yrs) with a range of 24-70 years. All participants had prior back pain with mean time since first ever attack being 8.8 years (SD 8.8 yrs). No samples contained significant DNA sequences relating to known human viral agents. Inconsequential retroviral sequences were commonly found and were a mixture of putative animal and human retroviral protein coding segments. All samples were negative for herpesvirus DNA when analysed by pan-herpesvirus PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found no viral pathogens in any intervertebral disc fragments of patients who had previous back pain and underwent discectomy for disc herniation and thus it is unlikely that viruses are associated with disc herniation, however given the contradiction between key studies enhanced replication of this experiment is recommended.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> B F Walker, A J Armson, M A O'Dea, J R White, C R P Lind, P R Woodland<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Musculoskelet Disord<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2474<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.05<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.880<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937280">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Risk factors for subsidence of titanium mesh cage following single-level anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: To clarify the risk factors for subsidence of titanium mesh cage (TMC) following single-level anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) to reduce subsidence.
METHODS: The present retrospective cohort study included 73 consecutive patients who underwent single-level ACCF. Patients were divided into subsidence (n = 31) and non-subsidence groups (n = 42). Medical records and radiological parameters such as age, sex, operation level, segmental angle (SA), cervical sagittal angle (CSA), height of anterior (HAE) and posterior endplate (HPE), ratio of anterior (RAE) and posterior endplate (RPE), the alignment of TMC, the global cervical Hounsfield Units (HU) were analyzed. Clinical results were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring system and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
RESULTS: Subsidence occurred in 31 of 73 (42.5%) patients. Comparison between the groups showed significant differences in the value of RAE, the alignment of TMC and the global cervical HU value (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, RAE > 1.18 (OR = 6.116, 95%CI = 1.613-23.192, p = 0.008), alignment of TMC > 3° (OR = 5.355, 95%CI = 1.474-19.454, p = 0.011) and the global cervical HU value< 333 (OR = 11.238, 95%CI = 2.844-44.413, p = 0.001) were independently associated with subsidence. Linear regression analysis revealed that RAE is significantly positive related to the extent of subsidence (r = - 0.502, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the value of RAE more than 1.18, alignment of TMC and poor bone mineral density are the risk factors for subsidence. TMC subsidence does not negatively affect the clinical outcomes after operation. Avoiding over expansion of intervertebral height, optimizing placing of TMC and initiation of anti-osteoporosis treatments 6 months prior to surgery might help surgeons to reduce subsidence after ACCF.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Ji, Shunzhi Yu, Ning Yan, Jiaxing Wang, Fang Hou, Tiesheng Hou, Weihua Cai<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Musculoskelet Disord<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2474<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.05<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.880<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937288">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MiR93-5p inhibits chondrocyte apoptosis in osteoarthritis by targeting lncRNA CASC2.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: It has been reported that miR-93-5p and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Cancer Susceptibility 2 (CASC2) play opposite roles in regulating chondrocyte apoptosis, indicating the possible interaction between them. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between miR-93-5p and lncRNA CASC2 in chondrocyte apoptosis, which plays critical roles in osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: The interaction between CASC2 and miR-93-5p was analyzed by dual luciferase assay and overexpression experiments. Levels of CASC2 and miR-93-5p in plasma sample from OA patients and healthy controls were measured by RT-qPCR. The roles of CASC2 and miR-93-5p in regulating the apoptosis of chondrocyte induced by LPS were analyzed by cell apoptosis assay.
RESULTS: Through bioinformatics analysis we observed the potential interaction between CASC2 and miR-93-5p, which was confirmed by dual luciferase assay. In OA patients, miR-93-5p was downregulated, while CASC2 was upregulated, and they were inversely correlated. LPS treatment led to downregulated miR-93-5p and upregulated CASC2. Overexpression of miR-93-5p led to the downregulated CASC2 in chondrocytes. Under LPS treatment, CASC2 overexpression promoted the apoptosis of chondrocyte. MiR-93-5p overexpression played an opposite role and attenuated the effects of CASC2 overexpression.

METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of medical education research for residents in radiation oncology to survey the research trends. We used publications available on MEDLINE, PubMed, and Scopus to conduct this scoping review.
RESULTS: We screened 221 full-text articles, 146 of which met our inclusion criteria. These publications showed increased activity in medical education research for residents, most involving affiliations in the United States. We identified persistent interest in training-, contouring-, and technology-related issues. An increase in research related to career, treatment quality, and multidisciplinary training was also observed. However, no research about teacher training was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review presents the trends in study interests among stakeholders of medical education research in radiation oncology. With an investigation of existing studies, this research identifies areas of high priority and a lack of studies about teacher training.

ED is highly prevalent in hypertensive patients. The effect of Li-ESWT on an animal model of hypertension-associated ED has not been reported.
AIM: To investigate the effect of Li-ESWT on hypertension-associated ED and provide plausible mechanisms of action of Li-ESWT on local mechanisms of penile erection.
METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) in the active group (n = 13) received Li-ESWT at energy flux density 0.06 mJ/mm
OUTCOMES: Erectile function was assessed with ICP, erectile tissue remodeling was studied by smooth muscle/collagen ratio, nNOS and CD31 were semiquantitatively evaluated on cavernosal sections.
RESULTS: The improvement of ICP parameters was greater in Li-ESWT-treated rats compared with controls with and without sildenafil. Sildenafil led to 20% increase in area under the intracavernosal pressure curve measured during the entire response/mean arterial pressure at 10 Hz in ESWT_SHR + sildenafil compared with ESWT_SHR. The smooth muscle/collagen ratio increased 2.5-fold in Li-ESWT compared with sham. Expression of CD31 tended to be increased whereas nNOS was unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: Li-ESWT by Aries may represent an effective noninvasive therapeutic alternative and a relevant add-on therapy to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for ED in hypertensive patients, and it is suggested that it acts via remodeling of the penile tissue and promoting cavernosal vascularization.

AIM: To assess the comorbidity between PE and ED.
METHODS: Male members of a shopping club in Taiwan aged 20-60 years with stable sexual relationships were invited to complete an online questionnaire.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-estimated intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool, Sexual Health Inventory for Men, Self-Esteem and Relationship, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale results were used.
RESULTS: A total of 937 participants with a mean age of 41.1 ± 10.2 years were enrolled. The prevalence rates of ED (Sexual Health Inventory for Men ≤ 21), PE (Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool ≥11), and IELT ≤1 minute were 24.7%, 6.3%, and 6.4%, respectively. Prevalence of acquired PE and IELT ≤1 minute increased marginally with age. Participants with ED had a greater prevalence of PE than those without ED (19.5% vs 2.0%, P < .001), and participants with PE had a greater prevalence of ED than those without PE (76.3% vs 19.4%, P < .001). Compared with participants without PE, participants with PE had greater adjusted odds of ED (odds ratio [OR] = 12.7, 95% CI = 6.7-24.2). Relative to participants without ED, participants with ED had increased adjusted odds of PE (OR = 7.2, 95% CI = 3.5-14.6 with mild ED and OR = 36.7, 95% CI = 16.2-83.0 with ED severity greater than a mild degree). Poor sexual relationships and self-esteem, depression, and anxiety were reported more frequently in those with PE or ED, especially in those with both problems compared with those without PE and ED.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a high prevalence of PE and ED coexistence, indicating a complicated relationship between the 2 conditions and the importance of screening for their co-occurrence in practice.

However, until now, studies on women's health related to the effect of sexuality on physical and psychosocial outcomes have been seriously ignored, especially the health-related quality of life (QOL) of reproductive-aged married female migrant workers.
AIM: To analyze the associations between sexuality-related factors and QOL and explore the independent contributions of sexuality-related factors to QOL in this population group in southern China.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 609 Chinese married female migrant workers aged 19-49 years were studied. Clustered multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the associations between sexuality-related variables and QOL.
OUTCOMES: QOL was measured using the Short Form (SF-36) Healthy Survey. Details of the participants (sociodemographic, health-related and sexuality-related factors) were obtained.
RESULTS: Approximately 10.0% of respondents always felt a lack of sexual interest and lubrication difficulties, and 37.5% of respondents seldom or never experienced sexual satisfaction. Multiple regression analyses revealed that women who never felt lubrication difficulties obtained higher role physical, bodily pain, general health, and physical component summary scores in physical domains and higher vitality (VT), mental health (MH), and mental component summary (MCS) scores in mental domains compared with those who always felt lubrication difficulties. Compared with those who always experienced sexual satisfaction, women who never experienced sexual satisfaction had relatively lower role physical, bodily pain, and general health scores in physical domains, and women who never or seldom experienced sexual satisfaction had lower VT, MH, and MCS scores in mental domains. The independent contributions of sexuality-related factors in mental domains (VT, MH, and MCS) accounted for 50.0%, 52.4%, and 39.5%, respectively; more than that of all sociodemographic and health-related variables in the VT and MH domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Sexuality-related factors (lubrication difficulties and sexual satisfaction) were significant independent determinants of QOL among reproductive-aged Chinese married female migrant workers, especially in mental domains.

Social media has been investigated in health care research to ascertain positive or negative feelings associated with several conditions but never in sexual medicine.
AIM: To assess perceptions related to erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) among Twitter users.
METHODS: Data collection was performed on a daily basis between May 24-October 9, 2018 (138 days) via an automated script. Data collection was then performed after data cleaning. The statistical software R and the rtweet packages were used in both phases.
RESULTS: We collected 11,000 unique tweets for PE and 30,546 unique tweets for ED. After data cleaning, we analyzed 7,020 tweets on PE and 22,648 tweets on ED by analyzing the most recurring words and the clusters describing word associations. The most popular words for ED were "Treatment," "Health," and "Viagra," whereas "Sex," "Sexual," and "Cure" were the top 3 for PE. Word clusters suggest the presence of some recurring themes, such as medical terms being grouped together. Additionally, tweets reflect the general feelings triggered by specific events, such as pieces of news pertaining to sexual dysfunctions.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Tweets on sexual dysfunctions are posted every day, with more tweets on ED than on PE. Treatment is among the chief topics discussed for both conditions, although health concerns differ between PE and DE tweets.
STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first analysis conducted on Tweets in the field of andrology and sexual medicine. A significant number of tweets were collected and analyzed. However, quantitative assessment of the sentiment was not feasible.
CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunctions are openly discussed on social media, and Twitter analysis could help understand the needs and interests of the general population on these themes.

DED affects patients' quality of life and leads eventually to decrease of productivity. Moreover, it has a considerable socioeconomic burden. It is a growing underdiagnosed health issue and the possible associated risk factors are very common and keep growing worldwide.
PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of DED and potential associated risk factors in the Northern West Bank of Palestine.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in 16 selected towns in Northern West Bank governorates during December 2016 to September 2017. An interviewer-assisted Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire was used to study DED symptoms in the study population. Further evaluation of clinical signs of DED was performed using the following objective tests: tear film break-up time (TBUT), fluorescein corneal staining (FL/S) and Schirmer test. Subjects with an OSDI score of 13 or above were considered symptomatic of DED, and DED was defined if an OSDI score ≥ 13 is accompanied by at least one of the following signs in the worse eye: TBUT ≤10 s, Schirmer score ≤ 5 mm and fluorescein corneal staining ≥ grade 1.
RESULTS: Seven hundred sixty-nine subjects were recruited from the general non-clinical population in the West Bank. The mean age of participants was 43.61 ± 18.57 years ranging from 18 to 90 years. Females constitute 52.7% of the study population. Based on the diagnostic criteria, the prevalence of DED was 64% (95% confidence interval 60.6-67.3). DED was significantly associated with female gender p = (0.001) and older age p = (0.001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DED is high in the study population. Older age and female gender were associated risk factors with the development of DED.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Yousef Shanti, Reham Shehada, May M Bakkar, Jamal Qaddumi<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Ophthalmol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2415<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.60<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.833<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931756">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The long-term effects of cancer survivorship on household assets.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Less is known about the impact of cancer on household assets and household financial portfolio during which cancer survivors face higher mortality risk. Economic theory predicts that cancer survivors would deplete their wealth in such a way that meets immediate financial needs for treatment and that hedges the risk of anticipated medical expenses associated with recurrence. Building upon this prediction, we examine long-term changes in household assets in response to cancer diagnosis among middle-aged and elderly Americans (age ≥ 50).
RESULTS: Using the 2000-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, we estimated the household fixed effects regression that regresses household assets on time elapsed since cancer diagnosis (≤ 2 years, > 2 but ≤4 years, > 4 but ≤6 years, and > 6 but ≤8 years). Regression estimates were adjusted for demographic characteristics, general health condition, employment outcomes, and household economic attributes. Household assets were measured by total net worth as well as the amount of savings held in each asset category. The loss of household assets attributable to cancer was estimated to be $125,832 in 2015 dollars per household with a cancer patient. This change came from statistically significant reductions in investment assets, miscellaneous savings, real estate equity, and business equity, and increases in unsecured debt. We also found 17.2-28.0% increases in cash and cash-equivalent assets from + 2 years since diagnosis through the rest of the study periods. The accumulation of cash was observed for both the well-insured group (multiple coverages) and those with limited insurance (single coverage).
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed evidence of both asset depletion and precautionary accumulation of liquid assets among cancer survivors, which reduces risk exposure of household financial portfolio. Our findings highlighted that household asset is an important source of liquidity to finance cancer care and to absorb the expected expenditure risk associated with cancer recurrence. We also showed that health insurance provides limited coverage of health risks associated with cancer.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Tae-Young Pak, Hyungsoo Kim, Kyoung Tae Kim<br><b>Journal:</b> Health Econ Rev<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2191-1991<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.730<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31933035">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gli promotes tumor progression through regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small-cell lung cancer.<br><b>Abstract:</b> INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. The most frequent histologic type of lung cancer is non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC often undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The components that control this process are thus promising therapeutic targets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gli/EMT protein expression levels were examined by western blot in paired NSCLC patient tissues and NSCLC cell lines. Functional analyses were performed to investigate SHH/Gli signaling and EMT in NSCLC cell lines. MTS cell viability, luciferase reporter, and western blot assays were performed to analyze pathway activity, while wound healing and transwell assays were executed to measure cell migration and invasion.
RESULTS: Higher Gli1 expressions were detected in tumor samples than in paired normal tissues. Differential expression of EMT biomarkers and activation of p-AKT were observed in tumor tissues. N-Shh stimulation of cells significantly increased reporter activity in NSCLC cell lines, while Gli-i treatment of transfected cells showed less relative reporter activity. When subjected to both Gli-i and N-Shh treatment, NSCLC cell lines continued to demonstrate decreased Gli transcriptional activity. Gli inhibition is associated with decreased expression level of p-AKT, N-cadherin and Vimentin. Knockdown of both Gli1 and Gli2 showed decreased EMT, migrative and invasive ability. Cells stimulated by N-Shh demonstrated greater mobility. In addition, AKT-i treated cells also demonstrated inhibited EMT activity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for aberrant upregulation of the Gli signaling pathway and a strong association between expression of Gli versus AKT and EMT markers in NSCLC.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Long Jiang, Jia Huang, Yingjie Hu, Peiji Lu, Qingquan Luo, Lei Wang<br><b>Journal:</b> J Cardiothorac Surg<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1749-8090<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.46<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.581<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931858">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Adult ALCAPA: from histological picture to clinical features.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital coronary anomaly that results in high mortality if left untreated. Our aim was to extend our knowledge of the histological, angiographic, and clinical characteristics of ALCAPA in order to deepen our understanding of this rare entity.
CASE PRESENTATION: We were involved in the assessment, treatment, and pathological evaluation of two adult ALCAPA patients who were rescued from ventricular fibrillation and then surgically treated to establish a dual coronary artery system. Histological studies indicated various chronic ischemic changes in the myocardium, patchy fibrosis, and severely thickened arteriolar walls in both ventricles. The first patient is alive and well 11.5 years after surgical correction without any implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) activations. The second patient required re-do surgery 9 months after the initial operation but subsequently died. Histologically, chronic ischemic alteration of the myocardium and thickened arteriolar walls persisted even after surgical correction, and coronary angiography (CAG) showed an extremely slow flow phenomenon even after surgical correction in both patients. The average postoperative opacification rate in the first case was 7.36 + 1.12 (n = 2) in the RCA, 3.81 + 0.51 (n = 3) in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and 4.08 + 0.27 (n = 4) in the left circumflex (LCx) artery. The slow flow phenomenon may represent persistent high arteriolar resistance in both ventricles.
CONCLUSIONS: Seldom reported or new findings in adult ALCAPA were identified in two cases. More frequent diagnosis of adult ALCAPA can be expected because of the widespread availability of resuscitation and more advanced diagnostic modalities. Accumulation of pathological and clinical findings and confirmation of the long-term follow-up results after treatment may contribute to expanding our knowledge of this rare entity and establishing optimal treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-14<br><b>Authors:</b> Hiroshi Kubota, Hidehito Endo, Hikaru Ishii, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Yusuke Inaba, Katsunari Terakawa, Yu Takahashi, Mio Noma, Kazuya Takemoto, Seiichi Taniai, Konomi Sakata, Kyoko Soejima, Hiroaki Shimoyamada, Hiroshi Kamma, Hayato Kawakami, Yukihiro Kaneko, Satoru Hirono, Daisuke Izumi, Kazuyuki Ozaki, Tohru Minamino, Hideaki Yoshino, Kenichi Sudo<br><b>Journal:</b> J Cardiothorac Surg<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1749-8090<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.46<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.581<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931842">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Controlled Delivery of Nitric Oxide for Cancer Therapy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived, endogenously produced, signaling molecule which plays multiple roles in mammalian physiology. Underproduction of NO is associated with several pathological processes; hence a broad range of NO donors have emerged as potential therapeutics for cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, wound healing, the immune response to infection, and cancer. However, short half-lives, chemical reactivity, rapid systemic clearance, and cytotoxicity have hindered the clinical development of most low molecular weight NO donors. Hence, for controlled NO delivery, there has been extensive effort to design novel NO-releasing biomaterials for tumor targeting.

The great challenge for the development of a pharmaceutical product is to create its new formulation and drug delivery system to limit solubility problems of existing drug candidate. Limited drug-loading capacity requires a large amount of carrier material to get appropriate encapsulation of the drug, which is another major challenge in the development of pharmaceutical product which could be resolved by developing nanocrystals (NCs). A significant research in the past few years has been done to develop NCs which helps in the delivery of poorly water soluble drugs via different routes. The technology could continue to thrive as a useful tool in pharmaceutical sciences for the improvement of drug solubility, absorption and bioavailability. Many crystalline compounds have pulled in incredible consideration much of the time, due to their ability to show good physical and chemical properties when contrasted with their amorphous counterparts. Nanocrystals have been proven to show atypical properties compared to the bulk.

We show cytoskeletal remodeling and changes in expression and activity of ROCK-myosin II pathway during acquisition of resistance to MAPK inhibitors. MAPK regulates myosin II activity, but after initial therapy response, drug-resistant clones restore myosin II activity to increase survival. High ROCK-myosin II activity correlates with aggressiveness, identifying targeted therapy- and immunotherapy-resistant melanomas. Survival of resistant cells is myosin II dependent, regardless of the therapy. ROCK-myosin II ablation specifically kills resistant cells via intrinsic lethal reactive oxygen species and unresolved DNA damage and limits extrinsic myeloid and lymphoid immunosuppression.
