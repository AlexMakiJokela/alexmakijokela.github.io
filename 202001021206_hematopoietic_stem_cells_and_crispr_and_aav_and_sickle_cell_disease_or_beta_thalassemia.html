However, transgene products may trigger immunological rejection of modified cells, limiting their therapeutic benefits. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI) allows for efficient engraftment and tolerance to gene-modified HSCs. In contrast, myeloablative chemotherapy using busulfan or similar agents is only sufficient to induce tolerance to gene-modified HSCs producing no or non-immunogenic protein. If cells are modified to produce a protein that is xenogenic or congenitally absent in the patient, additional immunosuppression may be required to prevent an immunological reaction to the transduced cells.

The advent of efficient virus-based methods for delivering therapeutic genes has enabled the development of genetic medicines for inherited disorders of the immune system, hemoglobinopathies, and a number of devastating metabolic diseases. Here, we briefly review the state of the art in the field, including gene editing approaches.

The ability to modify selectively specific genes provides a powerful tool for characterizing gene functions, performing gene therapy, correcting specific genetic mutations, eradicating diseases, engineering cells and organisms to achieve new and different functions and obtaining transgenic animals as models for studying specific diseases. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology has recently revolutionized genome engineering. The application of this new technology to stem cell research allows disease models to be developed to explore new therapeutic tools. The possibility of translating new systems of molecular knowledge to clinical research is particularly appealing for addressing degenerative diseases. In this review, we describe several applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to stem cells related to degenerative diseases. In addition, we address the challenges and future perspectives regarding the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as an important technology in the medical sciences.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria Teresa Valenti, Michela Serena, Luca Dalle Carbonare, Donato Zipeto<br><b>Journal:</b> World J Stem Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1948-0210<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.45<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.543<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768221">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Companies</h2> <br><br><b>Company Name:</b> CRISPR Therapeutics<br><b>Overview:</b> CRISPR Therapeutics is a leading gene-editing company focused on the development of transformative medicines using its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform. CRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary technology that allows for precise, directed changes to genomic DNA. Our multi-disciplinary team of world-class researchers and drug developers is working to translate this technology into breakthrough human therapeutics in a number of serious diseases. Our lead programs in beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease have advanced to IND/CTA-enabling studies with a CTA filing planned by the end of 2017, and we are advancing additional programs in ex vivo and in vivo disease areas. In addition to our fully-owned programs, our strategic collaborations with Bayer AG and Vertex Pharmaceuticals expand our portfolio and enable us with unique capabilities. Through our private financings, partnerships, and IPO we have raised >$400M to fund and accelerate our portfolio. We have licensed the foundational CRISPR/Cas9 patent estate for human therapeutic use from our scientific founder, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier, who co-invented the application of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing.
