Multiplexed functional assays, in which the functional effects of thousands of genomic variants are assessed simultaneously, are increasingly generating data that can be used as additional evidence for or against variant pathogenicity. Such assays have the potential to resolve variants of uncertain significance, thereby increasing the clinical utility of genomic testing. Existing standards from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) and new guidelines from the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) establish the role of functional data in variant interpretation, but do not address the specific challenges or advantages of using functional data derived from multiplexed assays. Here, we build on these existing guidelines to provide recommendations to experimentalists for the production and reporting of multiplexed functional data and to clinicians for the evaluation and use of such data. By following these recommendations, experimentalists can produce transparent, complete, and well-validated datasets that are primed for clinical uptake. Our recommendations to clinicians and diagnostic labs on how to evaluate the quality of multiplexed functional datasets, and how different datasets could be incorporated into the ACMG/AMP variant-interpretation framework, will hopefully clarify whether and how such data should be used. The recommendations that we provide are designed to enhance the quality and utility of multiplexed functional data, and to promote their judicious use.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Gelman, Jennifer N Dines, Jonathan Berg, Alice H Berger, Sarah Brnich, Fuki M Hisama, Richard G James, Alan F Rubin, Jay Shendure, Brian Shirts, Douglas M Fowler, Lea M Starita, None None<br><b>Journal:</b> Genome Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-994X<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 10.47<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.084<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862013">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gene therapy-emulating small molecule treatments in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells and patients.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Several small molecule corrector and potentiator drugs have recently been licensed for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) therapy. However, other aspects of the disease, especially inflammation, are less effectively treated by these drugs. We hypothesized that small molecule drugs could function either alone or as an adjuvant to licensed therapies to treat these aspects of the disease, perhaps emulating the effects of gene therapy in CF cells. The cardiac glycoside digitoxin, which has been shown to inhibit TNFα/NFκB signaling in CF lung epithelial cells, may serve as such a therapy.
METHODS: IB3-1 CF lung epithelial cells were treated with different Vertex (VX) drugs, digitoxin, and various drug mixtures, and ELISA assays were used to assess suppression of baseline and TNFα-activated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional responses to these drugs were assessed by RNA-seq and compared with gene expression in AAV-[wildtype]CFTR-treated IB3-1 (S9) cells. We also compared in vitro gene expression signatures with in vivo data from biopsied nasal epithelial cells from digitoxin-treated CF patients.
RESULTS: CF cells exposed to digitoxin exhibited significant suppression of both TNFα/NFκB signaling and downstream secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and GM-CSF, with or without co-treatment with VX drugs. No evidence of drug-drug interference was observed. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene therapy-treated CF lung cells induced changes in 3134 genes. Among these, 32.6% were altered by digitoxin treatment in the same direction. Shared functional gene ontology themes for genes suppressed by both digitoxin and gene therapy included inflammation (84 gene signature), and cell-cell interactions and fibrosis (49 gene signature), while genes elevated by both were enriched for epithelial differentiation (82 gene signature). A new analysis of mRNA data from digitoxin-treated CF patients showed consistent trends in expression for genes in these signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant gene therapy-emulating activities of digitoxin may contribute to enhancing the efficacy of currently licensed correctors and potentiators in CF patients.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Q Yang, A R Soltis, G Sukumar, X Zhang, H Caohuy, J Freedy, C L Dalgard, M D Wilkerson, H B Pollard, B S Pollard<br><b>Journal:</b> Respir.

Clinically, AAVs are showing increasing promise as viable candidates for treating multiple neurological diseases. Here, we briefly review the utility of AAVs in mapping neurocircuits, manipulating neuronal function and gene expression, and activity labeling in preclinical research studies as well as AAV-based gene therapies for diseases of the nervous system.

Premature stop codons are point mutations that disrupt protein synthesis from messenger RNA. As a consequence, patients with premature stop codon diseases have reduced or eliminated protein production from the mutation bearing allele accounting for some of the most severe phenotypes in these genetic diseases. These premature stop codons have been identified in over 1,800 rare and ultra-rare diseases. Read-through therapeutic development is focused on extending mRNA half-life and increasing protein synthesis by enabling the cytoplasmic ribosome to read through premature stop codons to produce full-length proteins. Eloxx’s lead product candidate, ELX-02, is a small molecule drug candidate designed to restore production of full-length functional proteins. ELX-02 is in the early stages of clinical development focusing on cystic fibrosis and cystinosis. ELX-02 is an investigational drug that has not been approved by any global regulatory body.

Talee Bio has two gene therapy product candidates to treat cystic fibrosis. The major hurdles of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis are poor efficacy (i.e., transduction efficiency, expression persistence, packaging capacity, avoidance of immunogenicity), low safety and tolerability (including genotoxicity for those vectors that result in genomic integration), and inability to manufacture sufficient vector.
