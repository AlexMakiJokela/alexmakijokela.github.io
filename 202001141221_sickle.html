There has been an international call for public input to inform a substantive debate about benefits and risks of HGE. This study investigates the views of the sickle cell disease (SCD) community. We utilized a mixed-methods approach to examine SCD stakeholders' views in the United States. We found SCD stakeholders hold a nuanced view of HGE. Assuming the technology is shown to be safe and effective, they are just as supportive of HGE as genetics professionals, but more supportive than the general public. However, they are also concerned about the potential implications of HGE, despite this support. As discourse surrounding HGE advances, it is crucial to engage disease communities and other key stakeholders whose lives could be altered by these interventions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Brittany M Hollister, Mariclare C Gatter, Khadijah E Abdallah, Alyssa J Armsby, Ashley J Buscetta, Yen Ji Julia Byeon, Kayla E Cooper, Stacy Desine, Anitra Persaud, Kelly E Ormond, Vence L Bonham<br><b>Journal:</b> CRISPR J<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2573-1602<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 1.0<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.32<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31742431">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Expression analysis data of BCL11A and γ-globin genes in KU812 and KG-1 cell lines after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BCL11A enhancer deletion.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled as "Targeted deletion of the BCL11A gene by CRISPR-Cas9 system for fetal hemoglobin reactivation: A promising approach for gene therapy of beta-thalassemia disease " [1]. BCL11A is a master regulator of γ-globin gene silencing, and suppresses fetal hemoglobin expression by association with other γ-globin suppressors, and also interacts with human beta-globin locus control region as well as intergenic region between the Aγ and δ-globin genes to reconfigure beta-globin cluster. Thus, HbF reactivation has been proposed to be an approach for the treatment of β-thalassemia through knockout of BCL11A. Accordingly, an erythroid enhancer sequence was identified that, when inactivated, led to repression of BCL11A and induction of γ-globin in the erythroid lineage [2-7].

The major clinical symptom of β-thal is severe chronic anemia-a decrease in RBC number and their hemoglobin content. In spite of the improvement in therapy, thal still severely affects the quality of life of the patients and their families and imposes a substantial financial burden on the community. These considerations position β-thal, among other hemoglobinopathies, as a major health and social problem that deserves increased efforts in research and its clinical application. These efforts are based on clinical studies, experiments in animal models and the use of erythroid cells grown in culture. The latter include immortal cell lines and cultures initiated by erythroid progenitor and stem cells derived from the blood and RBC producing (erythropoietic) sites of normal and thal donors, embryonic stem cells, and recently, "induced pluripotent stem cells" generated by manipulation of differentiated somatic cells. The present review summarizes the use of erythroid cultures, their technological aspects and their contribution to the research and its clinical application in thal. The former includes deciphering of the normal and pathological biology of the erythroid cell development, and the latter-their role in developing innovative therapeutics-drugs and methods of gene therapy, as well as providing an alternative source of RBC that may complement or substitute blood transfusions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-07<br><b>Authors:</b> Eitan Fibach<br><b>Journal:</b> J Clin Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2077-0383<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.43<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.15<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.78<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.274<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31810354">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Variation in zygotic CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes generates novel reporter and deletion alleles at the Gdf11 locus.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas gene editing technology have significantly expanded the possibilities and accelerated the pace of creating genetically engineered animal models. However, CRISPR/Cas-based strategies designed to precisely edit the genome can often yield unintended outcomes. Here, we report the use of zygotic CRISPR/Cas9 injections to generate a knock-in GFP reporter mouse at the Gdf11 locus. Phenotypic and genomic characterization of founder animals from these injections revealed a subset that contained the correct targeting event and exhibited GFP expression that, within the hematopoietic system, was restricted predominantly to lymphoid cells. Yet, in another subset of founder mice, we detected aberrant integration events at the target site that dramatically and inaccurately shifted hematopoietic GFP expression from the lymphoid to the myeloid lineage. Additionally, we recovered multiple Gdf11 deletion alleles that modified the C-terminus of the GDF11 protein. When bred to homozygosity, most of these alleles recapitulated skeletal phenotypes reported previously for Gdf11 knockout mice, suggesting that these represent null alleles. However, we also recovered one Gdf11 deletion allele that encodes a novel GDF11 variant protein ("GDF11-WE") predicted to contain two additional amino acids (tryptophan (W) and glutamic acid (E)) at the C-terminus of the mature ligand.

Not only does it affect ruminant animal populations, leading to a substantial financial burden for stockbreeders, but also poses severe public health issues. For almost four decades in southern Europe and elsewhere, eradication of the disease has been based on ambiguously effective programs, rendering massive sanitation of livestock urgent and indispensable. Gene therapy, which has been proved effective in the clinic, could possibly constitute an alternative option towards a permanent cure for brucellosis, by aiding in the deletion or inactivation of genes associated with the replication of Brucella within the host cells.
RESULTS: We infected ovine macrophages with B.melitensis, to simulate the host cell/microorganism interaction in vitro, and transduced the infected cells with CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors that target Brucella's RNA polymerase subunit A (RpolA) or virulence-associated gene virB10 at a multiplicity of infection of 60. We demonstrate a significant decrease in the bacterial load per cell when infected cells are transduced with the RpolA vector and that the number of internalized brucellae per cell remains unaffected when macrophages are transduced with a conventional lentiviral vector expressing the green fluorescence protein, thus underlining the bactericidal effect of our CRISPR/Cas9 system.
CONCLUSIONS: Pending in vivo verification of our findings, overall, these results may prove critical not only for the treatment of human brucellosis, but for other infectious diseases in general.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b>Authors:</b> Garyfalia Karponi, Spyridon K Kritas, Gina Papadopoulou, Elissavet-Kalliopi Akrioti, Eleni Papanikolaou, Evanthia Petridou<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Vet.

These assays are easy to perform and used in large-scale newborn screening in many countries. These tests however may not easily differentiate Sβ0 thalassemia from SS or identify other hemoglobin variants, and in this case, hemoglobin (HBB) gene sequencing may be necessary.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a high throughput DNA based confirmatory assay for SCD and to detect mutations in the HBB gene.
METHODS: We developed an automated pyrosequencing technique (PyS) based on QIAGEN technology (Hilden, Germany) to detect homozygous or heterozygous hemoglobin S mutations as well as hemoglobin C mutations. The technique was tested on 2,748 samples from patients enrolled in a multi-center SCD cohort in Brazil. Patients were previously tested using HPLC to diagnose SCD as part of routine clinical care. Any subjects with discrepant results between HPLC and PyS or with heterozygous hemoglobin S detected had Sanger sequencing of the HBB gene.
RESULTS: We identified 168 samples with discrepant results between HPLC and PyS and 100 with concordant PyS = heterozygous S and HPLC, which would suggest SB-thalassemia or other heterozygous S variants. The PyS assay correctly identified 1906 (98.7%) of the 1930 HbSS and 628 (98.7%) of the 636 HbSC samples. Of the 179 remaining samples, PyS correctly indicated S heterozygosis in 165 (92.2%). Of the 165 heterozygous S samples confirmed by Sanger as consistent with Sβ thalassemia genotype, 84 samples were classified as Sβ0 thalassemia and 81 as Sβ+ thalassemia. The most frequent beta thalassemia mutations of Sβ0 and Sβ+ were HBB: c.118C>T (Gln40Stop) and HBB c.92 + 6T> C, respectively.
DISCUSSION: The PyS proved to be satisfactory for large-scale confirmatory testing of hemoglobin mutation. Moreover, with this study we were able to describe the most common β+ and β0 mutations in SCD patients with Sβ-thalassemia in a large multi-institutional SCD cohort in Brazil.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Camila Cruz de Martino, Cecilia Salete Alencar, Paula Loureiro, Anna Barbara de Freitas Carneiro-Proietti, Claudia de Alvarenga Máximo, Rosimere Afonso Mota, Daniela Oliveira Werneck Rodrigues, Nelson Gaburo Junior, Shannon Kelly, Ester Cerdeira Sabino, None None<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS ONE<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1932-6203<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.23<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.87<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.100<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830127">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Sharpening the Molecular Scissors: Advances in Gene-Editing Technology.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The ability to precisely modify human genes has been made possible by the development of tools such as meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas. These now make it possible to generate targeted deletions, insertions, gene knock outs, and point variants; to modulate gene expression by targeting transcription factors or epigenetic machineries to DNA; or to target and modify RNA. Endogenous repair mechanisms are used to make the modifications required in DNA; they include non-homologous end joining, homology-directed repair, homology-independent targeted integration, microhomology-mediated end joining, base-excision repair, and mismatch repair. Off-target effects can be monitored using in silico prediction and sequencing and minimized using Cas proteins with higher accuracy, such as high-fidelity Cas9, enhanced-specificity Cas9, and hyperaccurate Cas9. Alternatives to Cas9 have been identified, including Cpf1, Cas12a, Cas12b, and smaller Cas9 orthologs such as CjCas9. Delivery of gene-editing components is performed ex vivo using standard techniques or in vivo using AAV, lipid nanoparticles, or cell-penetrating peptides. Clinical development of gene-editing technology is progressing in several fields, including immunotherapy in cancer treatment, antiviral therapy for HIV infection, and treatment of genetic disorders such as β-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, lysosomal storage disorders, and retinal dystrophy.

However, the key pathological processes underlying cyst development and exacerbation in pre-symptomatic stages remain unknown, because rodent models do not recapitulate critical disease phenotypes, including disease onset in heterozygotes. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9, we generate ADPKD models with PKD1 mutations in cynomolgus monkeys. As in humans and mice, near-complete PKD1 depletion induces severe cyst formation mainly in collecting ducts. Importantly, unlike in mice, PKD1 heterozygote monkeys exhibit cyst formation perinatally in distal tubules, possibly reflecting the initial pathology in humans. Many monkeys in these models survive after cyst formation, and cysts progress with age. Furthermore, we succeed in generating selective heterozygous mutations using allele-specific targeting. We propose that our models elucidate the onset and progression of ADPKD, which will serve as a critical basis for establishing new therapeutic strategies, including drug treatments.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Tomoyuki Tsukiyama, Kenichi Kobayashi, Masataka Nakaya, Chizuru Iwatani, Yasunari Seita, Hideaki Tsuchiya, Jun Matsushita, Kahoru Kitajima, Ikuo Kawamoto, Takahiro Nakagawa, Koji Fukuda, Teppei Iwakiri, Hiroyuki Izumi, Iori Itagaki, Shinji Kume, Hiroshi Maegawa, Ryuichi Nishinakamura, Saori Nishio, Shinichiro Nakamura, Akihiro Kawauchi, Masatsugu Ema<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.1<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822676">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genome Editing in Patient iPSCs Corrects the Most Prevalent <br><b>Abstract:</b> Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are characterized by progressive photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss.

Further improvements will come with successful implementation of strategies to enhance post-transplant immune reconstitution and to prevent leukemia relapse.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b>Authors:</b> Franco Aversa, Antonio Pierini, Loredana Ruggeri, Massimo Fabrizio Martelli, Andrea Velardi<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Immunol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-3224<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.06<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.021<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31827475">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The forces driving clonal expansion of the HIV-1 latent reservoir.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) which halts HIV-1 replication and reduces plasma viral load to clinically undetectable levels, viral rebound inevitably occurs once ART is interrupted. HIV-1-infected cells can undergo clonal expansion, and these clonally expanded cells increase over time. Over 50% of latent reservoirs are maintained through clonal expansion. The clonally expanding HIV-1-infected cells, both in the blood and in the lymphoid tissues, contribute to viral rebound. The major drivers of clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected cells include antigen-driven proliferation, homeostatic proliferation and HIV-1 integration site-dependent proliferation. Here, we reviewed how viral, immunologic and genomic factors contribute to clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected cells, and how clonal expansion shapes the HIV-1 latent reservoir.

Systematic studies on the size-dependent biological effects of nanoparticles not only help to unravel unknown toxicological mechanism but also contribute to the possible biological applications of nanomaterial.
METHODS: In this study, the biodistribution and the size-dependent biological effects of Fe
RESULTS: Our findings indicated that biodistribution and biological activities of Fe@Si-NPs demonstrated the obvious size-dependent and tissue-specific effects. Spleen and liver are the target tissues of Fe@Si-NPs, and 20 nm of Fe@Si-NPs showed a possible longer blood circulation time. Quantitative biochemical analysis showed that the alterations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid (UA) were correlated to some extent with the sizes of Fe@Si-NPs. The untargeted metabolomic analyses of tissue metabolomes (kidney, liver, lung, and spleen) indicated that different sizes of Fe@Si-NPs were involved in the different biochemical mechanisms. LDH, formate, uric acid, and GSH related metabolites were suggested as sensitive indicators for the size-dependent toxic effects of Fe@Si-NPs. The findings from serum biochemical analysis and metabolomic analysis corroborate each other. Thus we proposed a toxicity hypothesis that size-dependent NAD depletion may occur in vivo in response to nanoparticle exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first report that links size-dependent biological effects of nanoparticles with in vivo NAD depletion in rats.
CONCLUSION: The integrated metabolomic approach is an effective tool to understand physiological responses to the size-specific properties of nanoparticles. Our results can provide a direction for the future biological applications of Fe@Si-NPs.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Jinquan Li, Zhongxue Yuan, Huili Liu, Jianghua Feng, Zhong Chen<br><b>Journal:</b> J Nanobiotechnology<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1477-3155<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.02<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.255<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31870377">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The African Genomic Medicine Training Initiative (AGMT): Showcasing a Community and Framework Driven Genomic Medicine Training for Nurses in Africa.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The potential of genomic medicine in improving the quality of healthcare both at population and individual-level is well-recognized globally. However, successful adoption of genetic and genomic evidence into clinical practice depends on training the healthcare workforce and clinical researchers in genomic medicine. Due to limited expertise in the medical genetics and genomics field, widespread uptake largely depends on task-shifting for the implementation of genomic medicine implementation to key healthcare professionals such as nurses. Their knowledge would be developed through courses aimed at professional development. Globally, trainers, and training initiatives in genomic medicine are in early stages of development, but resource limited settings such as the African continent face additional logistical and institutional challenges. The African Genomic Medicine Training (AGMT) Initiative was conceived during a combined conference of the African Society of Human Genetics (AfSHG) and the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa) in 2016, Senegal, in response to the needs for developing knowledge and skills in genomic medicine. AGMT was established to implement a sustainable genomic medicine training initiative primarily for healthcare professionals who are not geneticists but are nurses, doctors, and pharmacists in Africa. This paper reports on the establishment of the AGMT initiative and the strategies developed and piloted by this initiative in designing and implementing an accredited frame-work and community-based blended learning course for nurses across 11 African countries. The global implementation experiences, outcomes and lessons learnt are highlighted. The AGMT initiative strategy takes advantage of existing research consortia and networks to train and create a pool of trainers and has adopted evidence-based approaches to guide curriculum and content development/adaptation. This initiative established the first Africa-wide online blended learning genomic medicine course which forms the basis from which to develop courses for other healthcare professionals and the wider public.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Victoria Nembaware, None None, Nicola Mulder<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Genet<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1664-8021<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.02<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.36<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.888<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31921282">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> 75th Congress of the Italian Society of Pediatrics : Bologna, Italy. 29 May - 1 June 2019.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> <br><b>Journal:</b> Ital J Pediatr<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1824-7288<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849329">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b>Authors:</b> <br><b>Journal:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>ISSN:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6951351/">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Abstract:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Publication date:</b> 1980-01-01<br><b>Authors:</b> <br><b>Journal:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>ISSN:</b> Unknown - Retrieval Error<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6946647/">Link</a></b><br><br><br><a name="companies"></a><h2>Companies</h2> <br><br><b>Company Name:</b> CRISPR Therapeutics<br><b>Overview:</b> CRISPR Therapeutics is a leading gene-editing company focused on the development of transformative medicines using its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform.
