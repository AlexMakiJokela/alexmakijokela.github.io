In evaluating the potential synergism of combining such strategies, however, we should consider the possibility of constraining trade-off phenotypes such as impairment in wound healing and immune response, tissue dysfunction and tumorigenesis. Moreover, we are rapidly learning that the benefit/risk ratio of aging-targeted interventions largely depends on intra- and inter-individual variations of susceptibility to the healthspan-, resilience-, and/or lifespan-promoting effects of the interventions. Here, we exemplify how computationally-generated proxies of the efficacy of a given lifespan/healthspan-promoting approach can predict the impact of baseline epigenetic heterogeneity on the positive outcomes of ketogenic diet and mTOR inhibition as single or combined anti-aging strategies.

Targeting aging itself might, therefore, be a better strategy than targeting each chronic disease individually for enhancing human health. Although much should be achieved for completely understanding the biological basis of aging, cellular senescence is now believed to mainly contribute to organismal aging via two independent, yet not mutually exclusive mechanisms: on the one hand, senescence of stem cells leads to exhaustion of stem cells and thus decreases tissue regeneration. On the other hand, senescent cells secrete many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases, collectively termed as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which causes chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. Much effort has been recently made to therapeutically target detrimental effects of cellular senescence including selectively eliminating senescent cells (senolytics) and modulating a proinflammatory senescent secretome (senostatics). Here, we discuss current progress and limitations in understanding molecular mechanisms of senolytics and senostatics and therapeutic strategies for applying them. Furthermore, we propose how these novel interventions for aging treatment could be improved, based on lessons learned from cancer treatment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Chanhee Kang<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

NF is a unique pathophysiological model for determining the direct consequences of cell iron dysregulation. We established lines of induced pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts from two NF patients and one isogenic control obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. NF fibroblasts, neural progenitors, and neurons exhibited the presence of increased cytosolic iron, which was also detectable as: ferritin aggregates, alterations in the iron parameters, oxidative damage, and the onset of a senescence phenotype, particularly severe in the neurons. In this spontaneous senescence model, NF cells had impaired survival and died by ferroptosis. Thus, non-ferritin-bound iron is sufficient per se to cause both cell senescence and ferroptotic cell death in human fibroblasts and neurons. These results provide strong evidence supporting the primary role of iron in neuronal aging and degeneration.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-07<br><b>Authors:</b> Anna Cozzi, Daniel I Orellana, Paolo Santambrogio, Alicia Rubio, Cinzia Cancellieri, Serena Giannelli, Maddalena Ripamonti, Stefano Taverna, Giulia Di Lullo, Ermanna Rovida, Maurizio Ferrari, Gian Luca Forni, Chiara Fiorillo, Vania Broccoli, Sonia Levi<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Reports<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2213-6711<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.60<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.698<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587993">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Valproic Acid Enhances Reprogramming Efficiency and Neuronal Differentiation on Small Molecules Staged-Induction Neural Stem Cells: Suggested Role of mTOR Signaling.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Inducing somatic cells into neural stem cells (iNSCs) in specific ways provides a new cell therapy in a variety of neurological diseases. In the past, iNSCs were generated by transcription factors which increased the risk of mutagenesis, tumor formations, and immune reactions by viral transduction vectors. Therefore, in this study, different small molecules were used to induce mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into iNSCs in different reprogramming stages, which showed high reprogramming efficiency without altering the genome. We demonstrated that the small molecules staged-induction neural stem cells (SMSINS) have the characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs) in morphology, gene expression, self-renewal and differentiation potential. Furthermore, valproic acid (VPA), one of small molecules, was showed to enhance neural induction with highest efficiency compared with six other small molecules, which were also investigated in the present study. Moreover, our results suggested that activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling enhanced the induction efficiency and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our findings indicated that using this induction program allowed us to obtain safe and efficient iNSCs which were free of genetic manipulation. The VPA-mediated mTOR signaling pathway may enhance reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation. So we suggested that this program could be a new method of obtaining iNSCs for the treatment of neurological diseases by cell replacement therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Qingrui Duan, Siyi Li, Xinrui Wen, Gavin Sunnassee, Jian Chen, Sheng Tan, Yang Guo<br><b>Journal:</b> Front Neurosci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1662-4548<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.24<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.81<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.665<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551670">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cellular reprogramming for successful CNS axon regeneration is driven by a temporally changing cast of transcription factors.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In contrast to mammals, adult fish display a remarkable ability to fully regenerate central nervous system (CNS) axons, enabling functional recovery from CNS injury. Both fish and mammals normally undergo a developmental downregulation of axon growth activity as neurons mature. Fish are able to undergo damage-induced "reprogramming" through re-expression of genes necessary for axon growth and guidance, however, the gene regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Here we present the first comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory reprogramming in zebrafish retinal ganglion cells at specific time points along the axon regeneration continuum from early growth to target re-innervation. Our analyses reveal a regeneration program characterized by sequential activation of stage-specific pathways, regulated by a temporally changing cast of transcription factors that bind to stably accessible DNA regulatory regions. Strikingly, we also find a discrete set of regulatory regions that change in accessibility, consistent with higher-order changes in chromatin organization that mark (1) the beginning of regenerative axon growth in the optic nerve, and (2) the re-establishment of synaptic connections in the brain.

Mechanistically, we revealed that the expression of Gldc, a rate-limiting GCS enzyme regulated by Sox2 and Lin28A, facilitates this activation. We further found that the activated GCS catabolizes glycine to fuel H3K4me3 modification, thus promoting the expression of pluripotency genes. Moreover, the activated GCS helps to cleave excess glycine and prevents methylglyoxal accumulation, which stimulates senescence in stem cells and during reprogramming.

However, in most cases, cancer cells seem to be resistant to cellular reprogramming. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of limited reprogramming in cancer cells are largely unknown. Here, we identified the candidate barrier genes and their target genes at the early stage of reprogramming for investigating cancer reprogramming.
Methods: We tried induction of pluripotency in normal human fibroblasts (BJ) and both human benign (MCF10A) and malignant (MCF7) breast cancer cell lines using a classical retroviral reprogramming method. We conducted RNA-sequencing analysis to compare the transcriptome of the three cell lines at early stage of reprogramming.
Results: We could generate iPSCs from BJ, whereas we were unable to obtain iPSCs from cancer cell lines. To address the underlying mechanism of limited reprogramming in cancer cells, we identified 29 the candidate barrier genes based on RNA-sequencing data. In addition, we found 40 their target genes using Cytoscape software.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that these genes might one of the roadblock for cancer cell reprogramming. Furthermore, we provide new insights into application of iPSCs technology in cancer cell field for therapeutic purposes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Jin Seok Bang, Na Young Choi, Minseong Lee, Kisung Ko, Yo Seph Park, Kinarm Ko<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Stem Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2005-3606<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.16<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.02<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.795<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474029">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Paradoxical Changes Underscore Epigenetic Reprogramming During Adult Zebrafish Extraocular Muscle Regeneration.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Purpose: Genomic reprogramming and cellular dedifferentiation are critical to the success of de novo tissue regeneration in lower vertebrates such as zebrafish and axolotl. In tissue regeneration following injury or disease, differentiated cells must retain lineage while assuming a progenitor-like identity in order to repopulate the damaged tissue. Understanding the epigenetic regulation of programmed cellular dedifferentiation provides unique insights into the biology of stem cells and cancer and may lead to novel approaches for treating human degenerative conditions.
Methods: Using a zebrafish in vivo model of adult muscle regeneration, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to characterize early changes in epigenetic signals, focusing on three well-studied histone modifications-histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and histone H3 trimethylated or acetylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3 and H3K27Ac, respectively).
Results: We discovered that zebrafish myocytes undergo a global, rapid, and transient program to drive genomic remodeling. The timing of these epigenetic changes suggests that genomic reprogramming itself represents a distinct sequence of events, with predetermined checkpoints, to generate cells capable of de novo regeneration. Importantly, we uncovered subsets of genes that maintain epigenetic marks paradoxical to changes in expression, underscoring the complexity of epigenetic reprogramming.
Conclusions: Within our model, histone modifications previously associated with gene expression act for the most part as expected, with exceptions suggesting that zebrafish chromatin maintains an easily editable state with a number of genes paradoxically marked for transcriptional activity despite downregulation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-03<br><b>Authors:</b> Christina F Tingle, Brian Magnuson, Yi Zhao, Curtis J Heisel, Phillip E Kish, Alon Kahana<br><b>Journal:</b> Invest.

Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest occurring in response to damage and stress and is considered a hallmark of ageing. Senescent cells accumulate in multiple organs during ageing, contribute to tissue dysfunction and give rise to pathological manifestations. Senescence is therefore a defining feature of a variety of human age-related disorders, including cancer, and targeted elimination of these cells has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to ameliorate tissue damage and promote repair and regeneration. In addition, in vivo identification of senescent cells has significant potential for early diagnosis of multiple pathologies.

Oct4 as the only one factor that cannot be substituted by other POU members, it is urgent need to develop a quantitative model for describing the spatial binding pattern with its target genes. The dynamic profiles of pioneer factor Oct4-binding showed that the major wave occurs at the intermediate stage of cell reprogramming (from day 7 to day 15), and the promoter is the preferred targeting regions. The Oct4-binding distributions perform significant chromosome bias. The overall enrichment on chromosome 1-11 is higher than that on the others. The dramatic event of TF-mediated reprogramming is mainly concentrated on autosomes. We also found that the spatial binding ability of Oct4 binding can be represented quantitatively by using three parameters of peaks (height, width and distance). The dynamic changes of Oct4-binding demonstrated that the width play more important roles in regulating expression of target genes. At last, a multivariate linear regression was introduced to establish the spatial binding model of the Oct4-binding. The evaluation results confirmed that the height and width is positively correlated with the gene expression. And the additive interaction terms of height and width can better optimize the model performance than the multiplicative terms. The best average coefficients of determination of improved model achieved to 81.38%.

EVs can act in a paracrine manner to facilitate communication between cells as well as modulate immune, inflammatory, regenerative, and remodeling processes. Of particular interest is the emerging association between EVs and stem cells, given their ability to integrate complex inputs for facilitating cellular migration to the sites of tissue injury. Additionally, stem cell-derived EVs can also act in an autocrine manner to influence stem cell proliferation, mobilization, differentiation, and self-renewal. Hence, it has been postulated that stem cells and EVs may work synergistically in the process of tissue repair and that dysregulation of EVs may cause a loss of homeostasis in the microenvironment leading to disease. By harnessing the property of EVs for delivery of small molecules, stem cell-derived EVs possess significant potential as a platform for developing bioengineering approaches for next-generation cancer therapies and targeted drug delivery methods. Although one of the main challenges of clinical cancer treatment remains a lack of specificity for the delivery of effective treatment options, EVs can be modified via genetic, biochemical, or synthetic methods for enhanced targeting ability of chemotherapeutic agents in promoting tumor regression. Here, we summarize recent research on the bioengineering potential of EV-based cancer therapies. A comprehensive understanding of EV modification may provide a novel strategy for cancer therapy and for the utilization of EVs in the targeting of oncogenic processes.

MSC-derived EVs have been identified as essential signaling mediators under both physiological and pathological conditions, and they appear to be responsible for many of the therapeutic effects of MSCs.

The AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β pathway regulates cell metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, and reprogramming, and p16 and p21, which act downstream of this pathway, regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis induced by reprogramming. Here, we aimed to elucidate the roles of PBX1 in regulating the proliferation and reprogramming of HF-MSCs.
METHODS: A lentiviral vector designed to carry the PBX1 sequence or PBX1 short hairpin RNA sequence was used to overexpress or knock down PBX1. The roles of PBX1 in proliferation and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate pluripotent gene expression. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to examine the transcriptional activity of the NANOG promoter. Western blotting was performed to identify the molecules downstream of PBX1 involved in proliferation and reprogramming. Caspase3 activity was detected to assess HF-MSC reprogramming. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT inhibitor LY294002 was used to inhibit the phosphorylation and activity of AKT.
RESULTS: Overexpression of PBX1 in HF-MSCs increased the phosphorylation of AKT and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, resulting in the progression of the cell cycle from G
CONCLUSIONS: PBX1 enhanced HF-MSC proliferation, and HF-MSCs induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) generation by activating the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. During the reprogramming of HF-MSCs into HF-iPSCs, PBX1 activated the NANOG promoter, upregulated NANOG, and inhibited mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis via the AKT/GSK3β pathway during the early stages of reprogramming.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Yixu Jiang, Feilin Liu, Fei Zou, Yingyao Zhang, Bo Wang, Yuying Zhang, Aobo Lian, Xing Han, Zinan Liu, Xiaomei Liu, Minghua Jin, Dianliang Wang, Gang Li, Jinyu Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cell Res Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1757-6512<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.66<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.548<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443676">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Understanding and Modulating Immunity With Cell Reprogramming.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cell reprogramming concepts have been classically developed in the fields of developmental and stem cell biology and are currently being explored for regenerative medicine, given its potential to generate desired cell types for replacement therapy. Cell fate can be experimentally reversed or modified by enforced expression of lineage specific transcription factors leading to pluripotency or attainment of another somatic cell type identity. The possibility to reprogram fibroblasts into induced dendritic cells (DC) competent for antigen presentation creates a paradigm shift for understanding and modulating the immune system with direct cell reprogramming. PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 were identified as sufficient and necessary to impose DC fate in unrelated cell types, taking advantage of Clec9a, a C-type lectin receptor with restricted expression in conventional DC type 1. The identification of such minimal gene regulatory networks helps to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing development and lineage heterogeneity along the hematopoietic hierarchy.

In theory, damaged and diseased tissues and organs can be regenerated or created using different configurations and combinations of extracellular matrix (ECM), cells, and inductive biomolecules. Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering can allow the improvement of patients' quality of life through availing novel treatment options. The coupling of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering with 3D printing, big data, and computational algorithms is revolutionizing the treatment of patients in a huge way. 3D bioprinting allows the proper placement of cells and ECMs, allowing the recapitulation of native microenvironments of tissues and organs. 3D bioprinting utilizes different bioinks made up of different formulations of ECM/biomaterials, biomolecules, and even cells. The choice of the bioink used during 3D bioprinting is very important as properties such as printability, compatibility, and physical strength influence the final construct printed. The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides both physical and mechanical microenvironment needed by cells to survive and proliferate. Decellularized ECM bioink contains biochemical cues from the original native ECM and also the right proportions of ECM proteins. Different techniques and characterization methods are used to derive bioinks from several tissues and organs and to evaluate their quality. This review discusses the uses of decellularized ECM bioinks and argues that they represent the most biomimetic bioinks available. In addition, we briefly discuss some polymer-based bioinks utilized in 3D bioprinting.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Dzobo, Keolebogile Shirley Caroline M Motaung, Adetola Adesida<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540457">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> miR-200 family members reduce senescence and restore idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis type II alveolar epithelial cell transdifferentiation.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Rationale: Alveolar type II (ATII) cells act as adult stem cells contributing to alveolar type I (ATI) cell renewal and play a major role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as supported by familial cases harbouring mutations in genes specifically expressed by these cells. During IPF, ATII cells lose their regenerative potential and aberrantly express pathways contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The microRNA miR-200 family is downregulated in IPF, but its effect on human IPF ATII cells remains unproven. We wanted to 1) evaluate the characteristics and transdifferentiating ability of IPF ATII cells, and 2) test whether miR-200 family members can rescue the regenerative potential of fibrotic ATII cells.
Methods: ATII cells were isolated from control or IPF lungs and cultured in conditions promoting their transdifferentiation into ATI cells. Cells were either phenotypically monitored over time or transfected with miR-200 family members to evaluate the microRNA effect on the expression of transdifferentiation, senescence and EMT markers.
Results: IPF ATII cells show a senescent phenotype (p16 and p21), overexpression of EMT (ZEB1/2) and impaired expression of ATI cell markers (AQP5 and HOPX) after 6 days of culture in differentiating medium. Transfection with certain miR-200 family members (particularly miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p) reduced senescence marker expression and restored the ability to transdifferentiate into ATI cells.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that ATII cells from IPF patients express senescence and EMT markers, and display a reduced ability to transdifferentiate into ATI cells. Transfection with certain miR-200 family members rescues this phenotype, reducing senescence and restoring transdifferentiation marker expression.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Silvia Moimas, Francesco Salton, Beata Kosmider, Nadja Ring, Maria C Volpe, Karim Bahmed, Luca Braga, Michael Rehman, Simone Vodret, Maria Laura Graziani, Marla R Wolfson, Nathaniel Marchetti, Thomas J Rogers, Mauro Giacca, Gerard J Criner, Serena Zacchigna, Marco Confalonieri<br><b>Journal:</b> ERJ Open Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2312-0541<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.35<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.135<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31857992">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> FGFR1 Induces Acquired Resistance Against Gefitinib By Activating AKT/mTOR Pathway In NSCLC.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Objective: As an epidermal growth factor, receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib demonstrates a good therapeutic effect in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, an overwhelming majority of these patients inevitably develop resistance against gefitinib. Unfortunately, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still not fully understood. Here we aim to reveal the mechanism of gefitinib resistance in NSCLC induced by FGFR1.
Materials and methods: We used high-throughput sequencing to compare the mRNA expression profiles of PC9 and PC9-GR (gefitinib-resistant) cells. The clinical significance of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in NSCLC was also investigated using immunohistochemistry and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Finally, the in vitro molecular mechanisms were analyzed using confocal laser microscopy, Western blotting, transwell assay, colony formation assay, CCK-8 assay, and apoptosis assay.
Results: We observed that FGFR1 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and was closely associated with poor prognosis. Cytological experiments showed that FGFR1 promoted the proliferation and migration of PC9-GR cells and mediated their resistance to gefitinib. Furthermore, studies aimed at unraveling this mechanism revealed that FGFR1 activated the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. These findings show that the FGFR1/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role in acquired resistance against gefitinib in NSCLC.
Conclusion: This work provides new evidence that FGFR1 functions as a key regulator of gefitinib resistance, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Dan Zhang, Li-Li Han, Fen Du, Xiao-Meng Liu, Jin Li, Hui-Hui Wang, Ming-Hui Song, Zeng Li, Guo-Yin Li<br><b>Journal:</b> Onco Targets Ther<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1178-6930<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.09<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.986<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31819480">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Next-generation disease modeling with direct conversion: a new path to old neurons.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Within just over a decade, human reprogramming-based disease modeling has developed from a rather outlandish idea into an essential part of disease research. While iPSCs are a valuable tool for modeling developmental and monogenetic disorders, their rejuvenated identity poses limitations for modeling age-associated diseases. Direct cell-type conversion of fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) circumvents rejuvenation and preserves hallmarks of cellular aging. iNs are thus advantageous for modeling diseases that possess strong age-related and epigenetic contributions and can complement iPSC-based strategies for disease modeling. In this review, we provide an overview of the state of the art of direct iN conversion and describe the key epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolic changes that occur in converting fibroblasts. Furthermore, we summarize new insights into this fascinating process, particularly focusing on the rapidly changing criteria used to define and characterize in vitro-born human neurons.

Although individually rare, these diseases collectively represent a significant health burden since they usually develop early in life and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst affected children. The heterogeneity and rarity of these disorders requires the use of an appropriate model system in order to characterize the mechanism of disease and develop useful therapeutics since standard drug trials are infeasible. A common approach to study human disease involves the use of animal models, especially rodents, but due to important biological and physiological differences, this model system may not recapitulate human disease. An alternative approach for studying the metabolic cardiomyopathies relies on the use of cellular models which have most frequently been immortalized cell lines or patient-derived fibroblasts. However, the recent introduction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body, is of great interest and has the potential to revolutionize the study of rare diseases. In this paper we review the advantages and disadvantages of each model system by comparing their utility for the study of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy with a particular focus on the use of iPSCs in cardiovascular biology for the modeling of rare genetic or metabolic diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Nerea Jimenez-Tellez, Steven C Greenway<br><b>Journal:</b> World J Cardiol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1949-8462<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31754410">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Cancer cell reprogramming: a promising therapy converting malignancy to benignity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in reprogramming terminally differentiated somatic cells and cancer cells into induced pluripotent cells and cancer cells with benign phenotypes. Recent studies have explored various approaches to induce reprogramming from one cell type to another, including lineage-specific transcription factors-, combinatorial small molecules-, microRNAs- and embryonic microenvironment-derived exosome-mediated reprogramming. These reprogramming approaches have been proven to be technically feasible and versatile to enable re-activation of sequestered epigenetic regions, thus driving fate decisions of differentiated cells. One of the significant utilities of cancer cell reprogramming is the therapeutic potential of retrieving normal cell functions from various malignancies. However, there are several major obstacles to overcome in cancer cell reprogramming before clinical translation, including characterization of reprogramming mechanisms, improvement of reprogramming efficiency and safety, and development of delivery methods. Recently, several insights in reprogramming mechanism have been proposed, and determining progress has been achieved to promote reprogramming efficiency and feasibility, allowing it to emerge as a promising therapy against cancer in the near future.

Here we assessed the interplay between OCT4 and SOX2 in controlling chromatin accessibility of mouse embryonic stem cells. We found that OCT4 and SOX2 operate in a largely independent manner even at co-occupied sites, and that their cooperative binding is mostly mediated indirectly through regulation of chromatin accessibility. Controlled protein degradation strategies revealed that the uninterrupted presence of OCT4 is required for post-mitotic re-establishment and interphase maintenance of chromatin accessibility, and that highly OCT4-bound enhancers are particularly vulnerable to transient loss of OCT4 expression.

Unfortunately, most of the tumours are refractive to the differentiation cues. The aim of this investigation was to analyse the effects of prolonged treatment with retinoic acid on two cell lines of neural origin refractive to differentiation. Cells were also treated with retinoic acid in combination with a poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor because PARP1 is a known chromatin modulator and can influence the process of differentiation. The main methods comprised tumour cell line culturing and treatment; analysis of RNA and protein expression after cell treatment; as well as analysis of urokinase activity, migration, and proliferation. Both cell lines continued to proliferate under the prolonged treatment and showed increase in urokinase plasminogen activator activity. Analysis of gene expression and cell phenotype revealed different mechanisms, which only in neuroblastoma H4 cells could indicate the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The data collected indicate that the activity of the urokinase plasminogen activator, although belonging to an extracellular protease, does not necessary lead to epithelial-mesenchymal reprogramming and increase in cell migration but can have different outcomes depending on the intracellular milieu.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Luka Horvat, Josip Madunić, Martina Grubar, Mariastefania Antica, Maja Matulić<br><b>Journal:</b> Biomedicines<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2227-9059<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.60<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.094<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547462">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A compendious summary of Parkinson's disease patient-derived iPSCs in the first decade.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The number of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients increases with aging, which brings heavy burden to families and society. The emergence of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has brought hope to the current situation of lacking new breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment of PD. In this article, we reviewed and analyzed the current researches related to PD patient-derived iPSCs, in order to provide solid theoretical basis for future study of PD. In 2008, successful iPSCs derived from PD patients were reported. The current iPSCs research in PD mostly focused on the establishment of specific iPSCs models of PD patients carrying susceptible genes. The main source of PD patient-derived iPSCs is skin fibroblasts and the mainstream reprogramming methodology is the mature "four-factor" method, which introduces four totipotent correlation factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc into somatic cells. The main sources of iPSCs are patients with non-pedigrees and there have been no studies involving both PD patients and unaffected carriers within the same family. Most of the existing studies of PD patient-derived iPSCs started with the induction method for obtaining dopaminergic neurons in the first instance, but therapeutic applications are being increased. Although it is not the ultimate panacea, and there are still some unsolved problems (e.g., whether the mutated genes should be corrected or not), a better understanding of iPSCs may be a good gift for both PD patients and doctors due to their advantages in diagnosis and treatment of PD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-13<br><b>Authors:</b> Chao Ren, Fen Wang, Li-Na Guan, Xiao-Yu Cheng, Cai-Yi Zhang, De-Qin Geng, Chun-Feng Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Ann Transl Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2305-5839<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.27<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.958<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31930086">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Impelling force and current challenges by chemicals in somatic cell reprogramming and expansion beyond hepatocytes.<br><b>Abstract:</b> In the field of regenerative medicine, generating numerous transplantable functional cells in the laboratory setting on a large scale is a major challenge.

Several recent studies have reported direct conversion of human somatic cells into stably proliferating induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). Importantly, iNSCs are easier, faster, and more cost-efficient to generate than induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also have a higher level of clinical safety. Stably, self-renewing iNSCs can be derived from different cellular sources, such as skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and readily differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages that are indistinguishable from their iPSC-derived counterparts or from NSCs isolated from primary tissues. This review focuses on the derivation and characterization of iNSCs and their biomedical applications. We first outline different approaches to generate iNSCs and then discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Much of the tumor resistance phenotype comes from its heterogeneity that halts the ability of therapeutic agents to eliminate all cancer cells effectively. Tumor heterogeneity is, in part, controlled by cancer stem cells (CSC). CSC may be considered the reservoir of cancer cells as they exhibit properties of self-renewal and plasticity and the capability of reestablishing a heterogeneous tumor cell population. The endowed resistance mechanisms of CSC are mainly attributed to several factors including cellular quiescence, accumulation of ABC transporters, disruption of apoptosis, epigenetic reprogramming, and metabolism. There is a current need to develop new therapeutic drugs capable of targeting CSC to overcome tumor resistance. Emerging in vitro and in vivo studies strongly support the potential benefits of combination therapies capable of targeting cancer stem cell-targeting agents.

Glutamine is the most bountiful and flexible amino acid in the body which provides adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) demands for cells. Emerging evidences support that glutamine which acts as the second metabolic regulator after glucose exerts crucial roles in bone homeostasis at cellular level, including the lineage allocation and proliferation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), the matrix mineralization of osteoblasts, and the biosynthesis in chondrocytes. The integrated mechanism consisting of WNT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway in a glutamine-dependent pattern is responsible to regulate the complex intrinsic biological process, despite more extensive molecules are deserved to be elucidated in glutamine metabolism further. Indeed, dysfunctional glutamine metabolism enhances the development of degenerative bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, and glutamine or glutamine progenitor supplementation can partially restore bone defects which may promote treatment of bone diseases, although the mechanisms are not quite clear.

The molecular basis for these mutations has remained elusive however, which is a considerable impediment to their potential medical application. Here we report a specific stage at which iPSC generation is not reduced in response to ionizing radiation, i.e. radio-resistance. Quite intriguingly, a G1/S cell cycle checkpoint deficiency occurs in a transient fashion at the initial stage of the genome reprogramming process. These cancer-like phenomena, i.e. a cell cycle checkpoint deficiency resulting in the accumulation of point mutations, suggest a common developmental pathway between iPSC generation and tumorigenesis. This notion is supported by the identification of specific cancer mutational signatures in these cells. We describe efficient generation of human integration-free iPSCs using erythroblast cells, which have only a small number of point mutations and INDELs, none of which are in coding regions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-11<br><b>Authors:</b> Ryoko Araki, Yuko Hoki, Tomo Suga, Chizuka Obara, Misato Sunayama, Kaori Imadome, Mayumi Fujita, Satoshi Kamimura, Miki Nakamura, Sayaka Wakayama, Andras Nagy, Teruhiko Wakayama, Masumi Abe<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31924765">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Emerging Roles of Cancer Stem Cells and Wnt/Beta-Catenin Signaling in Hepatoblastoma.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common form of primary liver malignancy found in pediatric populations. HB is considered to be clonal and arises from hepatoblasts, or embryonic liver progenitor cells. These less differentiated tumor-initiating progenitor cells, or cancer stem cells (CSCs), may contribute to tumor recurrence and resistance to therapies, and have high metastatic abilities. Phenotypic heterogeneity, undesired genetic and epigenetic alterations, and dysregulated signaling pathways provide CSCs with a survival advantage over current therapies. The molecular and cellular basis of HB and the mechanism of CSC induction are not fully understood. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is one of the major developmental pathways and is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HB and CSC formation.

The genetic disorder, which is caused by recessive mutations affecting the CLN3 gene, features progressive vision loss, cognitive and motor decline and other psychiatric conditions, seizure episodes, leading to premature death. Animal models have traditionally aid the understanding of the disease mechanisms and pathology and are very relevant for biomarker research and therapeutic testing.

Ageing is a risk factor for IPF and incidence has been demonstrated to increase with age. Decreased (macro)autophagy with age has been reported extensively in a variety of systems and diseases, including IPF. However, it is undetermined whether the role of faulty autophagy is causal or coincidental in the context of IPF. Here, we report that in alveolar epithelial cells inhibition of autophagy promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process implicated in embryonic development, wound healing, cancer metastasis and fibrosis. We further demonstrate that this is attained, at least in part, by increased p62/SQSTM1 expression that promotes p65/RELA mediated-transactivation of an EMT transcription factor, Snail2 (SNAI2), which not only controls EMT but also regulates the production of locally acting profibrogenic mediators.

While the biorefinery approach for fuels along with the coproduction of high-value compounds with industrial, therapeutic, or nutraceutical applications have the potential to make algal biofuels more economically viable, a number of challenges continue to hamper algal production systems at all levels. One such hurdle includes the metabolic trade-off often observed between the increased yields of desired products, such as triacylglycerols (TAG), and the growth of an organism. Initial genetic engineering strategies to improve lipid productivity in microalgae, which focused on overproducing the enzymes involved in fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis or inactivating competing carbon (C) metabolism, have seen some successes albeit at the cost of often greatly reduced biomass. Emergent approaches that aim at modifying the dynamics of entire metabolic pathways by engineering of pertinent transcription factors or signaling networks appear to have successfully achieved a balance between growth and neutral lipid accumulation.

RESULTS: Herein, we developed a light-triggerable formulation that takes advantage of host-guest chemistry to complex drugs functionalized with a guest molecule and release it after exposure to near infrared (NIR) light due to the disruption of the non-covalent host-guest interactions. The system is composed by a gold nanorod (AuNR), which generates plasmonic heat after exposure to NIR, a thin layer of hyaluronic acid immobilized to the AuNR upon functionalization with a macrocycle, cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]), and a drug functionalized with a guest molecule that interacts with the macrocycle. For proof of concept, we have used this formulation for the intracellular release of a derivative of retinoic acid (RA), a molecule known to play a key role in tissue development and homeostasis as well as during cancer treatment. We showed that the formulation was able to conjugate approximately 65 μg of RA derivative per mg of CB[6] @AuNR and released it within a few minutes after exposure to a NIR laser. Importantly, the bioactivity of RA released from the formulation was demonstrated in a reporter cell line expressing luciferase under the control of the RA receptor.

The proteostasis network consists of diverse interconnected pathways that function dynamically according to the needs of the cell to quality control and maintain protein homeostasis. The proteostasis machinery of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is finely adjusted in response to distinct stimuli during cell fate commitment to determine successful organism development. Growing evidence has shown different classes of chaperones regulating crucial cellular processes in PSCs. Histones chaperones promote proper nucleosome assembly and modulate the epigenetic regulation of factors involved in PSCs' rapid turnover from pluripotency to differentiation. The life cycle of pluripotency proteins from synthesis and folding, transport and degradation is finely regulated by chaperones and co-factors either to maintain the stemness status or to cell fate commitment. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the chaperone network that govern stemness and present the versatile role of chaperones in stem cells resilience.

It was recently reported that Sirt1 overexpression in kidney tubule ameliorates cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). However, whether pharmacological activation of Sirt1 also has a beneficial effect against the disease remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether SRT1720, a potent and specific activator of Sirt1, could ameliorate cisplatin-induced AKI. We found that SRT1720 treatment ameliorated cisplatin-induced acute renal failure and histopathological alterations. Increased levels of tubular injury markers in kidneys were significantly attenuated by SRT1720. SRT1720 treatment also suppressed caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death. Increased expression of 4-hydroxynonenal, elevated malondialdehyde level, and decreased ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione after cisplatin injection were significantly reversed by SRT1720. In addition, SRT1720 treatment decreased renal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented macrophage infiltration into damaged kidneys. We also showed that the therapeutic effects of SRT1720 were associated with reduced acetylation of p53 and nuclear factor kappa-B p65 and preservation of peroxisome function, as evidenced by recovered expression of markers for number and function of peroxisome. These results suggest that Sirt1 activation by SRT1720 would be a useful therapeutic option for cisplatin-induced AKI.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-22<br><b>Authors:</b> Jung-Yeon Kim, Jungmin Jo, Kiryeong Kim, Hyun-Jin An, Mi-Gyeong Gwon, Hyemin Gu, Hyun-Ju Kim, A Young Yang, Sung-Woo Kim, Eon Ju Jeon, Jae-Hyung Park, Jaechan Leem, Kwan-Kyu Park<br><b>Journal:</b> Antioxidants (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2076-3921<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.61<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.113<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431003">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Behind the Wheel of Epithelial Plasticity in KRAS-Driven Cancers.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cellular plasticity, a feature associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributes to tumor cell survival, migration, invasion, and therapy resistance.

Two congenital disorders, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Alström syndrome (ALMS), can serve as useful models to understand how β-cells are normally produced and regenerated. Both are characterized by obesity, loss of β-cells, and defects in primary cilia - the sensory center of cells. Primary cilia are cellular protrusions present in almost every vertebrate cell. This antenna-like organelle plays a crucial role in regulating several signaling pathways that direct proper development, proliferation, and homeostasis. Mutations in genes expressing ciliary proteins or proteins present at or near the base of the cilium lead to disorders, collectively called ciliopathies. BBS and Alström syndrome are such disorders. Though both BBS and Alström patients are obese, their childhood diabetes rates are vastly different, suggesting distinct pathogenesis underlying these two ciliopathies. Clinical studies suggest that BBS patients are protected against early onset diabetes by sustained or enhanced β-cell function. In contrast, Alström patients are more prone to develop diabetes. They have hyperinsulinemia, yet their β-cells fail to sense glucose and to regulate insulin secretion accordingly. These data suggest a potential role for primary cilia in maintaining a functional β-cell population and that defects in cilia or in ciliary proteins impair development and function of β-cells. Identifying the respective roles of primary cilia and ciliary proteins, such as BBS and ALMS1 may shed light on β-cell biology and uncover potentially novel targets for diabetes therapy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Sukanya Lodh<br><b>Journal:</b> Yale J Biol Med<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1551-4056<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.86<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.206<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543709">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> ALS Genetics, Mechanisms, and Therapeutics: Where Are We Now?<br><b>Abstract:</b> The scientific landscape surrounding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continues to shift as the number of genes associated with the disease risk and pathogenesis, and the cellular processes involved, continues to grow.

In 2006, researchers Takahashi and Yamanaka developed an alternative method of generating embryonic-like stem cells from adult cells, which they coined induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Such iPSCs possess most of the advantages of embryonic stem cells without the ethical stigma associated with derivation of the latter. The possibility of generating "custom-made" pluripotent cells, ideal for patient-specific disease models, alongside their possible applications in regenerative medicine and reproduction, has drawn a lot of attention to the field with numbers of iPSC studies published growing exponentially. IPSCs have now been generated for a wide variety of species, including but not limited to, mouse, human, primate, wild felines, bovines, equines, birds and rodents, some of which still lack well-established embryonic stem cell lines. The paucity of robust characterization of some of these iPSC lines as well as the residual expression of transgenes involved in the reprogramming process still hampers the use of such cells in species preservation or medical research, underscoring the requirement for further investigations.

Fortunately, sparked by the genetic revolution, stem cell reprogramming research and the advancing capabilities of personalization in medicine enable forward-thinking to unprecedented patient-specific modeling and cell therapies for Parkinson's disease using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In addition to modeling Parkinson's disease more accurately than chemically-induced animal models, patient-specific stem cell lines can be created, elucidating the effects of genetic susceptibility and sub-populations' differing responses to in vitro treatments. Sourcing cell therapy with iPSC lines provides ethical advantages because these stem cell lines do not require the sacrifice of human zygotes and genetically-specific drug trails can be tested in vitro without lasting damage to patients. In hopes of finally slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease or re-establishing function, iPSC lines can ultimately be corrected with gene therapy and used as cell sources for neural transplantation for Parkinson's disease. With relatively localized neural degeneration, similar to spinal column injury, Parkinson's disease presents a better candidacy for cell therapy when compared to other diffuse degeneration found in Alzheimer's or Huntington's Disease. Neurosurgical implantation of pluripotent cells poses the risk of an innate immune response and tumorigenesis. Precautions, therefore, must be taken to ensure cell line quality before transplantation. While cell quality can be quantified using a number of assays, a yielding a high percentage of therapeutically relevant dopaminergic neurons, minimal de novo genetic mutations, and standard chromosomal structure is of the utmost importance. Current techniques focus on iPSCs because they can be matched with donors using human leukocyte antigens, thereby reducing the severity and risk of immune rejection. In August of 2018, researchers in Kyoto, Japan embarked on the first human clinical trial using iPSC cell therapy transplantation for patients with moderate Parkinson's disease. Transplantation of many cell sources has already proven to reduce Parkinson's disease symptoms in mouse and primate models.

The TME provides a conducive but complex milieu for the tumors to thrive while incapacitating the immune cells that home there as part of our natural immunosurveillance mechanism. The orchestration of this successful survival strategy by tumor cells is associated with exploitation of numerous metabolic and immune checkpoints, as well as metabolic reprogramming in the tumor cells. Together these form an intricate network of feedback mechanisms that favor the growing tumor. In addition, an ecosystem of microbiota, proximal or distal to tumors, influences the successful survival or elimination of tumor cells mediated by immune cells. Discovery and clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) i.e., monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking specific immune checkpoints CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, have revolutionized therapy of various cancers. However, they are still associated with limited response rates, severe immune-related adverse events, development of resistance, and more serious exacerbation of cancer progression termed hyper-progressive disease. Checkpoint inhibitors only represent a milestone and not the finish-line in the quest for treating and curing cancer.

Inhibition of histone deacetylases abates c-MYC binding to the promoters of lysosomal and autophagy genes, granting promoter occupancy to the MiT/TFE members, TFEB and TFE3, and/or the autophagy regulator FOXH1. In pluripotent stem cells and cancer, suppression of lysosomal and autophagic function is directly downstream of c-MYC overexpression and may represent a hallmark of malignant transformation. We propose that, by determining the fate of these catabolic systems, this hierarchical switch regulates the adaptive response of cells to pathological and physiological cues that could be exploited therapeutically.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Ida Annunziata, Diantha van de Vlekkert, Elmar Wolf, David Finkelstein, Geoffrey Neale, Eda Machado, Rosario Mosca, Yvan Campos, Heather Tillman, Martine F Roussel, Jason Andrew Weesner, Leigh Ellen Fremuth, Xiaohui Qiu, Min-Joon Han, Gerard C Grosveld, Alessandra d'Azzo<br><b>Journal:</b> Nat Commun<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2041-1723<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 11.80<br><b>SJR:</b> 5.992<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399583">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Profiling the long noncoding RNA interaction network in the regulatory elements of target genes by chromatin in situ reverse transcription sequencing.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate the activity of target genes by participating in the organization of chromatin architecture.

Tumor cells employ different mechanisms to resist the targeting agent. Most commonly in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, secondary resistance mutations on the target kinase domain emerge to diminish the binding affinity of first- and second-generation inhibitors. Other alternative resistance mechanisms include activating complementary bypass pathways and phenotypic transformation. Sequential monotherapies promise to temporarily address the problem of acquired drug resistance, but evidently are limited by the tumor cells' ability to adapt and evolve new resistance mechanisms to persist in the drug environment. Recent studies have nominated a model of drug resistance and tumor progression under targeted therapy as a result of a small subpopulation of cells being able to endure the drug (minimal residual disease cells) and eventually develop further mutations that allow them to regrow and become the dominant population in the therapy-resistant tumor. This subpopulation of cells appears to have developed through a subclonal event, resulting in driver mutations different from the driver mutation that is tumor-initiating in the most common ancestor. As such, an understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity-the driving force behind minimal residual disease-is vital for the identification of resistance drivers that results from branching evolution. Currently available methods allow for a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of tumor heterogeneity in that issues associated with spatial and temporal heterogeneity can now be properly addressed. This review provides some background regarding intratumoral heterogeneity and how it leads to incomplete molecular response to targeted therapies, and proposes the use of single-cell methods, sequential liquid biopsy, and multiregion sequencing to discover the link between intratumoral heterogeneity and early adaptive drug resistance. In summary, minimal residual disease as a result of intratumoral heterogeneity is the earliest form of acquired drug resistance. Emerging technologies such as liquid biopsy and single-cell methods allow for studying targetable drivers of minimal residual disease and contribute to preemptive combinatorial targeting of both drivers of the tumor and its minimal residual disease cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-09<br><b>Authors:</b> Zuan-Fu Lim, Patrick C Ma<br><b>Journal:</b> J Hematol Oncol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1756-8722<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 8.71<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.960<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31815659">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Transcriptomic Dissection of Hepatocyte Heterogeneity: Linking Ploidy, Zonation, and Stem/Progenitor Cell Characteristics.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a long-standing debate regarding the biological significance of polyploidy in hepatocytes. Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that hepatocytes with different ploidy statuses behave differently in a context-dependent manner (eg, susceptibility to oncogenesis, regenerative ability after injury, and in vitro proliferative capacity). However, their overall transcriptomic differences in a physiological context is not known.
METHODS: By using microarray transcriptome analysis, we investigated the heterogeneity of hepatocyte populations with different ploidy statuses. Moreover, by using single-cell quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (scPCR) analysis, we investigated the intrapopulational transcriptome heterogeneity of 2c and 4c hepatocytes.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed that cell cycle-related genes were enriched in 8c hepatocytes, which is in line with the established notion that polyploidy is formed via cell division failure. Surprisingly, in contrast to the general consensus that 2c hepatocytes reside in the periportal region, in our bulk transcriptome and scPCR analyses, the 2c hepatocytes consistently showed pericentral hepatocyte-enriched characteristics. In addition, scPCR analysis identified a subpopulation within the 2c hepatocytes that co-express the liver progenitor cell markers Axin2, Prom1, and Lgr5, implying the potential biological relevance of this subpopulation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into hepatocyte heterogeneity, namely 2c hepatocytes are preferentially localized to the pericentral region, and a subpopulation of 2c hepatocytes show liver progenitor cell-like features in terms of liver progenitor cell marker expression (Axin2, Prom1, and Lgr5).<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-07<br><b>Authors:</b> Takeshi Katsuda, Kazunori Hosaka, Juntaro Matsuzaki, Wataru Usuba, Marta Prieto-Vila, Tomoko Yamaguchi, Atsunori Tsuchiya, Shuji Terai, Takahiro Ochiya<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2352-345X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.85<br><b>SJR:</b> 3.138<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493546">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genome-wide CRISPR screening reveals genetic modifiers of mutant EGFR dependence in human NSCLC.<br><b>Abstract:</b> EGFR-mutant NSCLCs frequently respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Over 70 GFAP missense mutations cause AxD, but the mechanism linking different mutations to disease-relevant phenotypes remains unknown. We used AxD patient brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes to investigate the hypothesis that AxD-causing mutations perturb key post-translational modifications (PTMs) on GFAP. Our findings reveal selective phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 in patients who died young, independently of the mutation they carried. AxD iPSC-astrocytes accumulated pSer13-GFAP in cytoplasmic aggregates within deep nuclear invaginations, resembling the hallmark Rosenthal fibers observed in vivo. Ser13 phosphorylation facilitated GFAP aggregation and was associated with increased GFAP proteolysis by caspase-6. Furthermore, caspase-6 was selectively expressed in young AxD patients, and correlated with the presence of cleaved GFAP.

Here, we show that Telomere Repeat Binding Factor 1 (TRF1), a component of the shelterin complex, regulates the genome-wide binding of polycomb and polycomb H3K27me3 repressive marks to pluripotency genes, thereby exerting vast epigenetic changes that contribute to the maintenance of mouse ES cells in a naïve state. We further show that TRF1 mediates these effects by regulating TERRA, the lncRNAs transcribed from telomeres. We find that TERRAs are enriched at polycomb and stem cell genes in pluripotent cells and that TRF1 abrogation results in increased TERRA levels and in higher TERRA binding to those genes, coincidental with the induction of cell-fate programs and the loss of the naïve state. These results are consistent with a model in which TRF1-dependent changes in TERRA levels modulate polycomb recruitment to pluripotency and differentiation genes. These unprecedented findings explain why TRF1 is essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-20<br><b>Authors:</b> Rosa María Marión, Juan J Montero, Isabel López de Silanes, Osvaldo Graña-Castro, Paula Martínez, Stefan Schoeftner, José Alejandro Palacios-Fábrega, Maria A Blasco<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426913">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Complexities of Metastasis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Therapies that prevent metastatic dissemination and tumor growth in secondary organs are severely lacking.

Tumor growth and especially dissemination are typically associated with activation of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. This phenotypic transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state promotes migration and survival both during development and in cancer progression. When re-activated in pathological contexts such as cancer, this type of developmental process confers additional stemness properties to specific subsets of cells. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem-like features that are responsible for the propagation of the tumor as well as therapy resistance and cancer relapse, but also for circulating tumor cell release and metastasis. In support of this concept, EMT transcription factors generate cells with stem cell properties and mediate chemoresistance. However, their role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma metastasis remains controversial. As such, a better characterization of CSC populations will be crucial in future development of therapies targeting these cells.

Previously we showed that the SUMO2-interacting motif within the viral latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANASIM) is essential for establishment and maintenance of KSHV latency. Here, we developed a luciferase based live-cell reporter system to screen inhibitors selectively targeting the interaction between LANASIM and SUMO2. Cambogin, a bioactive natural product isolated from the Garcinia genus (a traditional herbal medicine used for cancer treatment), was obtained from the reporter system screening to efficiently inhibit the association of SUMO2 with LANASIM, in turn reducing the viral episome DNA copy number for establishment and maintenance of KSHV latent infection at a low concentration (nM). Importantly, Cambogin treatments not only specifically inhibited proliferation of KSHV-latently infected cells in vitro, but also induced regression of PEL tumors in a xenograft mouse model.

GATA3 loss is associated with aggressive breast cancer development, but the mechanism by which breast cancer is affected by the loss of GATA3 function remains unclear. Here, we report that GATA3 expression is positively correlated with the expression of UTX, a histone H3K27 demethylase contained in the MLL4 methyltransferase complex, and that GATA3 recruits the chromatin-remodeling MLL4 complex and interacts directly with UTX, ASH2L, and RBBP5. Using RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we demonstrate that the GATA3/UTX complex synergistically regulates a cohort of genes including Dicer and UTX, which are critically involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

Targeted therapeutic development for TNBC is of primary significance as no targeted therapies are clinically indicated for this aggressive subset. In view of this, we conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis and correlated molecular features of chemorefractory RD tumors with recurrence for the purpose of guiding downstream therapeutic development.
METHODS: We assembled DNA and RNA sequencing data from RD tumors as well as pre-operative biopsies, lymphocytic infiltrate, and survival data as part of a molecular correlative to a phase II post-neoadjuvant clinical trial. Matched somatic mutation, gene expression, and lymphocytic infiltrate were assessed before and after chemotherapy to understand how tumors evolve during chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted categorizing cancers with TP53 mutations by the degree of loss as well as by the copy number of a locus of 18q corresponding to the SMAD2, SMAD4, and SMAD7 genes.
RESULTS: Analysis of matched somatic genomes pre-/post-NAC revealed chaotic acquisition of copy gains and losses including amplification of prominent oncogenes. In contrast, significant gains in deleterious point mutations and insertion/deletions were not observed. No trends between clonal evolution and recurrence were identified. Gene expression data from paired biopsies revealed enrichment of actionable regulators of stem cell-like behavior and depletion of immune signaling, which was corroborated by total lymphocytic infiltrate, but was not associated with recurrence. Novel characterization of TP53 mutation revealed prognostically relevant subgroups, which were linked to MYC-driven transcriptional amplification. Finally, somatic gains in 18q were associated with poor prognosis, likely driven by putative upregulation of TGFß signaling through the signal transducer SMAD2.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude TNBCs are dynamic during chemotherapy, demonstrating complex plasticity in subclonal diversity, stem-like qualities, and immune depletion, but somatic alterations of TP53/MYC and TGFß signaling in RD samples are prominent drivers of recurrence, representing high-yield targets for additional interrogation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Bradley A Hancock, Yu-Hsiang Chen, Jeffrey P Solzak, Mufti N Ahmad, David C Wedge, Dumitru Brinza, Charles Scafe, James Veitch, Rajesh Gottimukkala, Walt Short, Rutuja V Atale, Mircea Ivan, Sunil S Badve, Bryan P Schneider, Xiongbin Lu, Kathy D Miller, Milan Radovich<br><b>Journal:</b> Breast Cancer Res.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1465-542X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 5.74<br><b>SJR:</b> 2.874<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383035">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> NANOG helps cancer cells escape NK cell attack by downregulating ICAM1 during tumorigenesis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: At the beginning of tumorigenesis, newly born cancer cells must successfully avoid attack by the immune system. Although most abnormal cells are efficiently identified and destroyed by the immune system, particularly by NK cells, the molecular mechanisms by which newly born cancer cells evade NK cell surveillance are not fully understood.
METHODS: NK cell resistance of highly tumorigenic population of human prostate cancer (PCa) cells were confirmed by xenograft in SCID mice with or without NK cell neutralization. The mechanisms by which the tumorigenic PCa cells evaded NK cell attack were investigated by RNAseq, ChIPseq, generation of several transformants and xenograft in SCID mice.
RESULTS: Here, we show that PCa cells have a strengthened ability to escape NK cell attack due to NANOG, a pluripotent-related transcription factor, mediating the repression of ICAM1, a cell adhesion molecule, during tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, NANOG directly binds to the region upstream of ICAM1. As the binding between NANOG and the upstream ICAM1 region increases, p300 binding to this region is diminished, resulting in decreased ICAM1 expression. High NANOG expression confers PCa cells the ability to resist NK cell attack via the repression of ICAM1. Consistent with these results, low ICAM1 expression is significantly correlated with a high recurrence rate in patients with PCa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that repression of ICAM1 is a critical mechanism by which cancer cells evade attack from NK cells during tumorigenesis. These results suggest a pivotal role of NANOG in establishing a gene expression profile for escaping the immune system.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Kotaro Saga, Jinhee Park, Keisuke Nimura, Norihiko Kawamura, Airi Ishibashi, Norio Nonomura, Yasufumi Kaneda<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

This gene encodes an essential lysosomal enzyme that converts glycogen to glucose. While enzyme replacement therapy helps some, our understanding of disease pathophysiology is limited. In this project we develop computer simulated stem cells (aiPSC) and differentiated skeletal muscle cells (aiSkMC) to empower IOPD research and drug discovery. Our Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, DeepNEU v3.6 was used to generate aiPSC and aiSkMC simulations with and without GAA expression. These simulations were validated using peer reviewed results from the recent literature. Once the aiSkMC simulations (IOPD and WT) were validated they were used to evaluate calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function in IOPD. Lastly, we used aiSkMC IOPD simulations to identify known and novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. The aiSkMC simulations of IOPD correctly predicted genotypic and phenotypic features that were reported in recent literature. The probability that these features were accurately predicted by chance alone using the binomial test is 0.0025. The aiSkMC IOPD simulation correctly identified L-type calcium channels (VDCC) as a biomarker and confirmed the positive effects of calcium channel blockade (CCB) on calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. These published data were extended by the aiSkMC simulations to identify calpain(s) as a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for IOPD. This is the first time that computer simulations of iPSC and differentiated skeletal muscle cells have been used to study IOPD.

The pathway codes a binary fate switch. Upon activation, downstream signals contribute to resolution of fate dichotomies such as proliferation/differentiation or sub-lineage differentiation outcome. There is, however, an interesting paradox in the Notch signalling pathway. Despite remarkable predictability of fate outcomes instructed by the Notch pathway, the associated transcriptome is versatile and plastic. This inconsistency suggests the presence of an interface that compiles input from the plastic transcriptome of the Notch pathway but communicates only a binary output in biological decisions. Herein, we address the interface that determines fate outcomes. We provide an alternative hypothesis for the Notch pathway as a biological master switch that operates by induction of genetic noise and bistability in order to facilitate resolution of dichotomous fate outcomes in development.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Filip Vujovic, Neil Hunter, Ramin M Farahani<br><b>Journal:</b> Cell Commun.

Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq regions with scRNA-seq genes that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process. The ability of linked SOMs to detect emergent properties from multiple types of highly-dimensional genomic data with very different signal properties opens new avenues for integrative analysis of heterogeneous data.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-04<br><b>Authors:</b> Camden Jansen, Ricardo N Ramirez, Nicole C El-Ali, David Gomez-Cabrero, Jesper Tegner, Matthias Merkenschlager, Ana Conesa, Ali Mortazavi<br><b>Journal:</b> PLoS Comput.

Here, we aimed to explore how microRNAs (miRs) can affect cell survival and EMT in HNSCC cells under an inflammatory microenvironment. By using a high-content screening (HCS) approach, we evaluated alterations in morphometric parameters, as well as expression/localization of Snail/Slug, in HNSCC cells primed with TNF-α.

Global CRC burden is expected to increase by 60% in the next decade, with low-income countries experiencing an escalation of CRC incidence and mortality in parallel to the adoption of western lifestyles. CRC incidence is also sharply increasing in individuals younger than 50 years, often presenting at advanced stages and with aggressive features. Both genetic and environmental factors have been recognized as major contributors for the development of CRC, the latter including diet-related conditions such as chronic inflammation and obesity. In particular, a diet rich in fat and sugars (Western-style diet, WSD) has been shown to induce multiple pathophysiological changes in the intestine linked to an increased risk of CRC. In this scenario, dietary factors have been recently shown to play novel unexpected roles in the regulation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and of the gut microbiota, which represent the two main biological systems responsible for intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, diet is increasingly recognized to play a key role in the neoplastic transformation of ISCs and in the metabolic regulation of colorectal cancer stem cells. This review illustrates novel discoveries on the role of dietary components in regulating intestinal homeostasis and colorectal tumorigenesis. Particular focus is dedicated to new areas of research with potential clinical relevance including the effect of food components on ISCs and cancer stem cells (CSCs), the existence of CRC-specific microbial signatures and the alterations of intestinal homeostasis potentially involved in early-onset CRC. New insights on the role of dietary factors in intestinal regulation will provide new tools not only for the prevention and early diagnosis of CRC but also for improving the effectiveness of current CRC therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Federica Francescangeli, Maria Laura De Angelis, Ann Zeuner<br><b>Journal:</b> Nutrients<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2072-6643<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.493<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816977">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Gain-of-Function Mutant p53: All the Roads Lead to Tumorigenesis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The p53 protein is mutated in about 50% of human cancers. Aside from losing the tumor-suppressive functions of the wild-type form, mutant p53 proteins often acquire inherent, novel oncogenic functions, a phenomenon termed mutant p53 gain-of-function (GOF). A growing body of evidence suggests that these pro-oncogenic functions of mutant p53 proteins are mediated by affecting the transcription of various genes, as well as by protein-protein interactions with transcription factors and other effectors. In the current review, we discuss the various GOF effects of mutant p53, and how it may serve as a central node in a network of genes and proteins, which, altogether, promote the tumorigenic process. Finally, we discuss mechanisms by which "Mother Nature" tries to abrogate the pro-oncogenic functions of mutant p53. Thus, we suggest that targeting mutant p53, via its reactivation to the wild-type form, may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for many cancers that harbor mutant p53. Not only will this strategy abrogate mutant p53 GOF, but it will also restore WT p53 tumor-suppressive functions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Yan Stein, Varda Rotter, Ronit Aloni-Grinstein<br><b>Journal:</b> Int J Mol Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1422-0067<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.21<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.312<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817996">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A Low Iron Diet Protects from Steatohepatitis in a Mouse Model.<br><b>Abstract:</b> High tissue iron levels are a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To investigate causal relationships and underlying mechanisms, we used an established NAFLD model-mice fed a high fat diet with supplemental fructose in the water ("fast food", FF). Iron did not affect excess hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mice on FF, and FF did not affect iron accumulation compared to normal chow. Mice on low iron are protected from worsening of markers for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including serum transaminases and fibrotic gene transcript levels. These occurred prior to the onset of significant insulin resistance or changes in adipokines. Transcriptome sequencing revealed the major effects of iron to be on signaling by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, a known mechanistic factor in NASH. High iron increased fibrotic gene expression in vitro, demonstrating that the effect of dietary iron on NASH is direct.

Ubiquitin specific peptidase 26 (USP26) is an X chromosome-linked deubiquitinase that is specifically expressed in the testes. It has long been controversial whether USP26 variants are associated with human male infertility. Thus, in the present study, we introduced a mutation into the Usp26 gene in mice and found that Usp26 mutant males backcrossed to a DBA/2 background, but not a C57BL/6 background, were sterile or subfertile and had atrophic testes. These findings indicate that the effects of the Usp26 mutation on male reproductive capacity were influenced by genetic background. Sperm in the cauda epididymis of Usp26 mutant mice backcrossed to a DBA/2 background were decreased in number and showed a malformed head morphology compared to those of wild-type mice. Additionally, histological examinations of the testes revealed that the number of round and elongated spermatids were dramatically reduced in Usp26 mutant mice. The mutant mice exhibited unsynapsed chromosomes in pachynema and defective chiasma formation in diplonema, which presumably resulted in apoptosis of metaphase spermatocytes and subsequent decrease of spermatids. Taken together, these results indicate that the deficiencies in fertility and spermatogenesis caused by mutation of Usp26 were dependent on genetic background.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-25<br><b>Authors:</b> Kohei Sakai, Chizuru Ito, Mizuki Wakabayashi, Satoko Kanzaki, Toshiaki Ito, Shuji Takada, Kiyotaka Toshimori, Yoichi Sekita, Tohru Kimura<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551464">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Clinical implications of drug-screening assay for recurrent metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal receptor 2-negative breast cancer using conditionally reprogrammed cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Various new drugs have been developed for treating recurrent hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. However, directly identifying effective drugs remains difficult. In this study, we elucidated the clinical relevance of cultured cells derived from patients with recurrent HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The recently established conditionally reprogrammed (CR) cell system enables us to examine heterogeneity, drug sensitivity and cell function using patient-derived tumour samples. The results of microarray analysis, DNA target sequencing and xenograft experiments indicated that the mutation status and pathological features were preserved in CR cells, whereas RNA expression was different from that in the primary tumour cells, especially with respect to cell adhesion-associated pathways. The results of drug sensitivity assays involving the use of primary breast cancer CR cells were consistent with gene expression profiling test data. We performed drug-screening assays using liver metastases, which were sensitive to 66 drugs. Importantly, the result reflected the actual clinical course of this patient. These results supported the use of CR cells obtained from the metastatic lesions of patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer for predicting the clinical drug efficacy.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Rei Mimoto, Satomi Yogosawa, Hiroki Saijo, Atsushi Fushimi, Hiroko Nogi, Tadashi Asakura, Kiyotsugu Yoshida, Hiroshi Takeyama<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527634">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Esophageal 3D organoids of <br><b>Abstract:</b> Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive cancer with late-stage detection and poor prognosis.

This study aimed to explore the role of LINC00908 in prostate cancer (PCa) and its possible underlying mechanisms.
Methods: Microarray data associated with PCa were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to screen the differentially expressed genes or lncRNAs. Then, the expression of LINC00908 in PCa tissues and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The localization of LINC00908 in PCa cells was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The relationship among LINC00908, microRNA (miR)-483-5p, and TSPYL5 was detected by bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP), and FISH assays. Cell biological behaviors were assessed after the expression of LINC00908, miR-483-5p, and TSPYL5 was altered in PCa cells. Lastly, tumor growth in nude mice was evaluated.
Results: Poorly expressed LINC00908 was witnessed in PCa tissues and cells. LINC00908 competitively bound to miR-483-5p to up-regulate the TSPYL5 expression. Overexpression of LINC00908 resulted in reduced PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Additionally, the suppression on PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion was induced by up-regulation of TSPYL5 or inhibition of miR-483-5p. In addition, in vivo experiments showed that overexpression of LINC00908 inhibited tumor growth of PCa.
Conclusion: Overall, LINC00908 could competitively bind to miR-483-5p to increase the expression of TSPYL5, thereby inhibiting the progression of PCa. Therefore, LINC00908 may serve as a novel target for the treatment of PCa.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Li Fan, Hai Li, Yun Zhang<br><b>Journal:</b> Cancer Cell Int.<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1475-2867<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.63<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.180<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31938018">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genome-wide analysis of the cotton G-coupled receptor proteins (GPCR) and functional analysis of GTOM1, a novel cotton GPCR gene under drought and cold stress.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: The efficient detection and initiation of appropriate response to abiotic stresses are important to plants survival. The plant G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are diverse membranous proteins that are responsible for signal transduction.
RESULTS: In this research work, we identified a novel gene of the GPCR domain, transformed and carried out the functional analysis in Arabidopsis under drought and cold stresses. The transgenic lines exposed to drought and cold stress conditions showed higher germination rate, increased root length and higher fresh biomass accumulation. Besides, the levels of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) exhibited continuously increasing trends, with approximately threefold higher than the control, implying that these ROS-scavenging enzymes were responsible for the detoxification of ROS induced by drought and cold stresses. Similarly, the transgenic lines exhibited stable cell membrane stability (CMS), reduced water loss rate in the detached leaves and significant values for the saturated leaves compared to the wild types. Highly stress-responsive miRNAs were found to be targeted by the novel gene and based on GO analysis; the protein encoded by the gene was responsible for maintaining an integral component of membrane. In cotton, the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) plants exhibited a higher susceptibility to drought and cold stresses compared to the wild types.
CONCLUSION: The novel GPCR gene enhanced drought and cold stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants by promoting root growth and induction of ROS scavenging enzymes. The outcome showed that the gene had a role in enhancing drought and cold stress tolerance, and can be further exploited in breeding for more stress-resilient and tolerant crops.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Pu Lu, Richard Odongo Magwanga, Joy Nyangasi Kirungu, Qi Dong, Xiaoyan Cai, Zhongli Zhou, Xingxing Wang, Yanchao Xu, Yuqing Hou, Renhai Peng, Kunbo Wang, Fang Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> BMC Genomics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1471-2164<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.53<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.829<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412764">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Identification of Shoot Differentiation-Related Genes in <br><b>Abstract:</b> De novo shoot regeneration is one of the important manifestations of cell totipotency in organogenesis, which reflects a survival strategy organism evolved when facing natural selection.

Early diagnosis and prompt medical attention can improve quality of life and the prognosis of CRC patients. Accumulating evidence reveals that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as oncogenes or anti-oncogenes, as well as biomarkers in various cancers.
AIM: To investigate the levels and molecular mechanism of the lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in CRC.
METHODS: The levels of lncRNA MEG3 in CRC tissue, serum and cell line samples were explored 
RESULTS: Significant decreased levels of MEG3 existed in CRC tissue, cell lines and serum. CRC patients with down-regulated serum MEG3 levels had larger tumor sizes, and advanced clinical stages. The sensitivity and specificity of serum MEG3 levels in CRC detection was 0.667 and 0.875, respectively. Tumor size, T stages, and serum MEG3 levels are indie factors that produce an effect on CRC patients' prognosis. Kaplan‑Meier survival curves suggested that CRC patients with high levels of MEG3 had a remarkably better overall survival rate.
CONCLUSION: LncRNA MEG3 is down-regulated in CRC, and regulates cell functions by targeting adenosine deaminase's effect on RNA 1 in CRC.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-15<br><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Ying Xie, Fei Chen, Xu Liu, Li-Li Zhong, Hai-Qiang Wang, Qing-Chang Li<br><b>Journal:</b> World J.

However, the theme trends and knowledge structures for human neural stem cells have not yet been studied bibliometrically. In this study, we retrieved 2742 articles from the PubMed database from 2013 to 2018 using "Neural Stem Cells" as the retrieval word. Co-word analysis was conducted to statistically quantify the characteristics and popular themes of human neural stem cell-related studies. Bibliographic data matrices were generated with the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder. We identified 78 high-frequency Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. A visual matrix was built with the repeated bisection method in gCLUTO software. A social network analysis network was generated with Ucinet 6.0 software and GraphPad Prism 5 software. The analyses demonstrated that in the 6-year period, hot topics were clustered into five categories. As suggested by the constructed strategic diagram, studies related to cytology and physiology were well-developed, whereas those related to neural stem cell applications, tissue engineering, metabolism and cell signaling, and neural stem cell pathology and virology remained immature. Neural stem cell therapy for stroke and Parkinson's disease, the genetics of microRNAs and brain neoplasms, as well as neuroprotective agents, Zika virus, Notch receptor, neural crest and embryonic stem cells were identified as emerging hot spots. These undeveloped themes and popular topics are potential points of focus for new studies on human neural stem cells.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Juan Wei, Bei Shi, Xin Guan, Jing-Yun Ma, Ya-Chen Wang, Jing Liu<br><b>Journal:</b> Neural Regen Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1673-5374<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.39<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.674<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169201">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Taking central nervous system regenerative therapies to the clinic: curing rodents <br><b>Abstract:</b> The central nervous system is known to have limited regenerative capacity. Not only does this halt the human body's reparative processes after central nervous system lesions, but it also impedes the establishment of effective and safe therapeutic options for such patients. Despite the high prevalence of stroke and spinal cord injury in the general population, these conditions remain incurable and place a heavy burden on patients' families and on society more broadly. Neuroregeneration and neural engineering are diverse biomedical fields that attempt reparative treatments, utilizing stem cells-based strategies, biologically active molecules, nanotechnology, exosomes and highly tunable biodegradable systems (e.g., certain hydrogels). Although there are studies demonstrating promising preclinical results, safe clinical translation has not yet been accomplished. A key gap in clinical translation is the absence of an ideal animal or ex vivo model that can perfectly simulate the human microenvironment, and also correspond to all the complex pathophysiological and neuroanatomical factors that affect functional outcomes in humans after central nervous system injury. Such an ideal model does not currently exist, but it seems that the nonhuman primate model is uniquely qualified for this role, given its close resemblance to humans. This review considers some regenerative therapies for central nervous system repair that hold promise for future clinical translation. In addition, it attempts to uncover some of the main reasons why clinical translation might fail without the implementation of nonhuman primate models in the research pipeline.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Magdalini Tsintou, Kyriakos Dalamagkas, Nikos Makris<br><b>Journal:</b> Neural Regen Res<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1673-5374<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.39<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.674<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571651">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Cancer Microbiota: EMT and Inflammation as Shared Molecular Mechanisms Associated with Plasticity and Progression.<br><b>Abstract:</b> With the advent of novel molecular platforms for high-throughput/next-generation sequencing, the communities of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the human body have been defined in depth. In the last decade, the role of microbiota-host interactions in driving human cancer plasticity and malignant progression has been well documented. Germ-free preclinical models provided an invaluable tool to demonstrate that the human microbiota can confer susceptibility to various types of cancer and can also modulate the host response to therapeutic treatments. Of interest, besides the detrimental effects of dysbiosis on cancer etiopathogenesis, specific microorganisms have been shown to exert protective activities against cancer growth. This has strong clinical implications, as restoration of the physiologic microbiota is being rapidly implemented as a novel anticancer therapeutic strategy. Here, we reviewed past and recent literature depicting the role of microbiota-host interactions in modulating key molecular mechanisms that drive human cancer plasticity and lead to malignant progression. We analyzed microbiota-host interactions occurring in the gut as well as in other anatomic sites, such as oral and nasal cavities, lungs, breast, esophagus, stomach, reproductive tract, and skin. We revealed a common ground of biological alterations and pathways modulated by a dysbiotic microbiota and potentially involved in the control of cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms most frequently affected by the pathogenic microorganisms to induce malignant progression involve epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) dependent barrier alterations and tumor-promoting inflammation. This evidence may pave the way to better stratify high-risk cancer patients based on unique microenvironmental/microbial signatures and to develop novel, personalized, biological therapies.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Vergara, Pasquale Simeone, Marina Damato, Michele Maffia, Paola Lanuti, Marco Trerotola<br><b>Journal:</b> J Oncol<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1687-8450<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.26<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.087<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772577">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Rosuvastatin Attenuates Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Upregulating <br><b>Abstract:</b> Myocardial diseases usually appear ischemic.

For the study of neurodegenerative diseases, especially sporadic cases where the "disease condition" might be restricted towards the neuroectodermal lineage, obtaining the affected neurons is important to help unravel the underlying molecular mechanism leading to the diseases. Although differentiation of iPSCs to neural lineage allows acquisition of cell types of interest, the technology suffers from low efficiency leading to low yield of neurons. Here, we investigated the potential of adult neuroprogenitor cells (aNPCs) for iPSC derivation and possible confounders such as cell density of infected NPCs on their subsequent neuronal differentiation potential from reprogrammed cells under isogenic conditions.

Dynamin-related protein 1 is one of the evolutionarily highly conserved large family of GTPase proteins. Drp1 is critical for mitochondrial division, size, shape, and distribution throughout the neuron, from cell body to axons, dendrites, and nerve terminals. Several decades of intense research from several groups revealed that Drp1 is enriched at neuronal terminals and involved in synapse formation and synaptic sprouting. Different phosphorylated forms of Drp1 acts as both increased fragmentation and/or increased fusion of mitochondria. Increased levels of Drp1 were found in diseased states and caused excessive fragmentation of mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage. In the last two decades, several Drp1 inhibitors have been developed, including Mdivi-1, Dynasore, P110, and DDQ and their beneficial effects tested using cell cultures and mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent research using genetic crossing studies revealed that a partial reduction of Drp1 is protective against mutant protein(s)-induced mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities. Based on findings from cell cultures, mouse models and postmortem brains of AD and other neurodegenerative disease, we cautiously conclude that reduced Drp1 is a promising therapeutic target for AD and other neurological diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-08-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Darryll Oliver, P Hemachandra Reddy<br><b>Journal:</b> Cells<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4409<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450774">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Isolation, Characterization, and Safety Evaluation of Human Skin-Derived Precursors from an Adherent Monolayer Culture System.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) are promising candidates for regenerative medicine. Several studies have transcultured human SKPs (termed tSKPs) from fibroblasts (FBs) expanded in monolayer culture. Herein, we optimized the procedure by treating flasks with poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA).
Methods: tSKPs generated from our adherent monolayer culture system were investigated for protein expression and differentiation capacity. The aggregated cells and the proliferative cells within tSKP spheres were detected by mix-culturing FBs expressing two different fluorescent proteins and BrdU- or EdU-positive cells, respectively. To distinguish tSKPs from FBs, we compared their phenotypes and transcriptomes. The tumorigenicity of tSKPs and FBs was also assessed in our study.
Results: tSKPs expressed Versican, Fibronectin, Vimentin, Sox2, and Nestin. Under appropriate stimuli, tSKPs could differentiate to mesenchymal or neural lineages. While these spheres were heterogeneous populations consisting of both proliferative and aggregated cells, the rate of proliferative cells correlated with a seeding density. tSKPs, isolated from FBs, were distinctive from FBs in cell cycle, marker expression, neural differentiation potential, and transcript profiles despite the two sharing partial similarity in certain properties. As for tumorigenesis, both tSKPs and FBs could be considered as nontumorigenic 
Conclusion: tSKPs were heterogeneous populations presenting similar characteristics as traditional SKPs, while being different from FBs. The potential mixture of FBs in spheres did not affect the biosafety of tSKPs, as both of which had normal karyotype and nontumorigenicity. Taken together, we suggested tSKPs had potential applications in regenerative medicine.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Ru Dai, Wei Hua, Wei Chen, Lidan Xiong, Li Li, Yiming Li<br><b>Journal:</b> Stem Cells Int<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1687-966X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531027">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells : Clinical Significance and Applications in Neurologic Diseases.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells using gene transfer opens new areas for precision medicine with personalized cell therapy and encourages the discovery of essential platforms for targeted drug development. iPSCs retain the genome of the donor, may regenerate indefinitely, and undergo differentiation into virtually any cell type of interest using a range of published protocols.
