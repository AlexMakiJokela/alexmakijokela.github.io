We aimed to assess the effects of aging on intestinal barrier function in humans in vivo and ex vivo. In this cross-sectional study, healthy subjects and subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) of older (65-75 years) and young adult age (18-40 years) were compared. In vivo gastrointestinal site-specific permeability was assessed by a multi-sugar test, taking into account potential confounders. Sigmoid biopsies were collected from subgroups of healthy young adults and elderly for ex vivo Ussing chamber experiments, gene transcription of barrier-related genes and staining of junctional proteins. No significant differences between healthy young adults and elderly were found for small intestinal, colonic and whole gut permeability (P ≥ 0.142). In IBS patients, gastroduodenal and colonic permeability did not differ significantly (P ≥ 0.400), but small intestinal and whole gut permeability were higher in elderly versus young adults (P ≤ 0.009), mainly driven by the IBS-diarrhea subtype. Ussing chamber experiments with or without stressor (P ≥ 0.052), and relative expression of intestinal barrier-related genes (P ≥ 0.264) showed no significant differences between healthy elderly and young adults, as confirmed by immunofluorescent stainings. Overall, the functional capacity of the intestinal barrier is maintained in elderly.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Wilms, Freddy J Troost, Montserrat Elizalde, Bjorn Winkens, Paul de Vos, Zlatan Mujagic, Daisy M A E Jonkers, Ad A M Masclee<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949225">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A multimodal neuroimaging classifier for alcohol dependence.<br><b>Abstract:</b> With progress in magnetic resonance imaging technology and a broader dissemination of state-of-the-art imaging facilities, the acquisition of multiple neuroimaging modalities is becoming increasingly feasible. One particular hope associated with multimodal neuroimaging is the development of reliable data-driven diagnostic classifiers for psychiatric disorders, yet previous studies have often failed to find a benefit of combining multiple modalities. As a psychiatric disorder with established neurobiological effects at several levels of description, alcohol dependence is particularly well-suited for multimodal classification. To this aim, we developed a multimodal classification scheme and applied it to a rich neuroimaging battery (structural, functional task-based and functional resting-state data) collected in a matched sample of alcohol-dependent patients (N = 119) and controls (N = 97). We found that our classification scheme yielded 79.3% diagnostic accuracy, which outperformed the strongest individual modality - grey-matter density - by 2.7%. We found that this moderate benefit of multimodal classification depended on a number of critical design choices: a procedure to select optimal modality-specific classifiers, a fine-grained ensemble prediction based on cross-modal weight matrices and continuous classifier decision values. We conclude that the combination of multiple neuroimaging modalities is able to moderately improve the accuracy of machine-learning-based diagnostic classification in alcohol dependence.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Guggenmos, Katharina Schmack, Ilya M Veer, Tristram Lett, Maria Sekutowicz, Miriam Sebold, Maria Garbusow, Christian Sommer, Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, Ulrich S Zimmermann, Michael N Smolka, Henrik Walter, Andreas Heinz, Philipp Sterzer<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941972">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A Modified Aging Kinetics Model for Aging Condition Prediction of Transformer Polymer Insulation by Employing the Frequency Domain Spectroscopy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The aging kinetics model is of great interest to scholars since it is capable of describing the variation law between the degree of polymerization (<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Jiefeng Liu, Xianhao Fan, Yiyi Zhang, Hanbo Zheng, Zixiao Wang, Xixi Zhao<br><b>Journal:</b> Polymers (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4360<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.12<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.13<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.724<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31842471">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> A GSH Fluorescent Probe with a Large Stokes Shift and Its Application in Living Cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Intracellular GSH is the most abundant non-protein biothiol and acts as a central antioxidant to defend against aging toxins and radicals.

The system could acquire signals from 8 PPG probes and 10 ECG leads. Each PPG probe was constituted of a light-emitting diode (LED) source at a wavelength of 940 nm and a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detector, located in a back-reflection recording configuration. In order to ensure proper optode-to-skin coupling, the probe was equipped with insufflating cuffs. The high number of PPG probes allowed us to simultaneously acquire signals from multiple body locations. The ECG provided a reference for single-pulse PPG evaluation and averaging, allowing the extraction of indices of cardiovascular status with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Firstly, the system was characterized on optical phantoms. Furthermore, in vivo validation was performed by estimating the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a metric associated with cardiovascular status. The validation was performed on healthy volunteers to assess the baPWV intra- and extra-operator repeatability and its association with age. Finally, the baPWV, evaluated via the developed instrumentation, was compared to that estimated with a commercial system used in clinical practice (Enverdis Vascular Explorer). The validation demonstrated the system's reliability and its effectiveness in assessing the cardiovascular status in arterial ageing.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b>Authors:</b> David Perpetuini, Antonio Maria Chiarelli, Lidia Maddiona, Sergio Rinella, Francesco Bianco, Valentina Bucciarelli, Sabina Gallina, Vincenzo Perciavalle, Vincenzo Vinciguerra, Arcangelo Merla, Giorgio Fallica<br><b>Journal:</b> Sensors (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1424-8220<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.08<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.51<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.592<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31861123">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Microglial regional heterogeneity and its role in the brain.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Microglia have been recently shown to manifest a very interesting phenotypical heterogeneity across different regions in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). However, the underlying mechanism and functional meaning of this phenomenon are currently unclear. Baseline diversities of adult microglia in their cell number, cellular and subcellular structures, molecular signature as well as relevant functions have been discovered. But recent transcriptomic studies using bulk RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq have produced conflicting results on region-specific signatures of microglia. It is highly speculative whether such spatial heterogeneity contributes to varying sensitivities of individual microglia to the same physiological and pathological signals in different CNS regions, and hence underlie their functional relevance for CNS disease development. This review aims to thoroughly summarize up-to-date knowledge on this specific topic and provide some insights on the potential underlying mechanisms, starting from microgliogenesis. Understanding regional heterogeneity of microglia in the context of their diverse neighboring neurons and other glia may provide an important clue for future development of innovative therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-27<br><b>Authors:</b> Yun-Long Tan, Yi Yuan, Li Tian<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

With the ongoing opioid epidemic and the insufficient effect of acetaminophen on severe pain; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are heavily used to alleviate this pain. However, NSAIDs are known to inhibit postoperative healing of connective tissues by inhibiting prostaglandin signaling. Pain intensity, inflammatory mediators associated with wound healing and the pharmacological action of NSAIDs vary throughout the day due to the circadian rhythm regulated by the clock genes. According to this rhythm, most of wound healing mediators and connective tissue formation occurs during the resting phase, while pain, inflammation and tissue resorption occur during the active period of the day. Here we show, in a murine tibia fracture surgical model, that NSAIDs are most effective in managing postoperative pain, healing and recovery when drug administration is limited to the active phase of the circadian rhythm. Limiting NSAID treatment to the active phase of the circadian rhythm resulted in overexpression of circadian clock genes, such as Period 2 (Per2) at the healing callus, and increased serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and vascular endothelial growth factor. By contrast, NSAID administration during the resting phase resulted in severe bone healing impairment.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> H Al-Waeli, B Nicolau, L Stone, L Abu Nada, Q Gao, M N Abdallah, E Abdulkader, M Suzuki, A Mansour, A Al Subaie, F Tamimi<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949183">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Identification, functional prediction, and key lncRNA verification of cold stress-related lncRNAs in rats liver.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cold stimulation reduces the quality of animal products and increases animal mortality, causing huge losses to the livestock industry in cold regions. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) take part in many biological processes through transcriptional regulation, intracellular material transport, and chromosome remodeling. Although cold stress-related lncRNAs have been reported in plants, no research is available on the characteristic and functional analysis of lncRNAs after cold stress in rats. Here, we built a cold stress animal model firstly. Six SPF male Wistar rats were randomly divided to the acute cold stress group (4 °C, 12 h) and the normal group (24 °C, 12 h). lncRNA libraries were constructed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using rat livers. 2,120 new lncRNAs and 273 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs were identified in low temperature environments. The target genes of DElncRNA were predicted by cis and trans, and then functional and pathway analysis were performed to them. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that lncRNA targets were mainly participated in the regulation of nucleic acid binding, cold stimulation reaction, metabolic process, immune system processes, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and pathways in cancer. Next, a interaction network between lncRNA and its targets was constructed. To further reveal the mechanism of cold stress, DElncRNA and DEmRNA were extracted to reconstruct a co-expression sub-network. We found the key lncRNA MSTRG.80946.2 in sub-network. Functional analysis of key lncRNA targets showed that targets were significantly enriched in fatty acid metabolism, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and pathways in cancer under cold stress. qRT-PCR confirmed the sequencing results. Finally, hub lncRNA MSTRG.80946.2 was characterized, and verified its relationship with related mRNAs by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) interference and qRT-PCR. Results confirmed the accuracy of our analysis. To sum up, our work was the first to perform detailed characterization and functional analysis of cold stress-related lncRNAs in rats liver. lncRNAs played crucial roles in energy metabolism, growth and development, immunity and reproductive performance in cold stressed rats. The MSTRG.80946.2 was verified by network and experiments to be a key functional lncRNA under cold stress, regulating ACP1, TSPY1 and Tsn.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Hong Ji, Chunyang Niu, Xuelong Zhan, Jing Xu, Shuai Lian, Bin Xu, Jingru Guo, Li Zhen, Huanmin Yang, Shize Li, Li Ma<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949263">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Polycystin 2 is increased in disease to protect against stress-induced cell death.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Polycystin 2 (PC2 or TRPP1, formerly TRPP2) is a calcium-permeant Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) cation channel expressed primarily on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and primary cilia of all cell and tissue types. Despite its ubiquitous expression throughout the body, studies of PC2 have focused primarily on its role in the kidney, as mutations in PC2 lead to the development of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a debilitating condition for which there is no cure. However, the endogenous role that PC2 plays in the regulation of general cellular homeostasis remains unclear. In this study, we measure how PC2 expression changes in different pathological states, determine that its abundance is increased under conditions of cellular stress in multiple tissues including human disease, and conclude that PC2-deficient cells have increased susceptibility to cell death induced by stress. Our results offer new insight into the normal function of PC2 as a ubiquitous stress-sensitive protein whose expression is up-regulated in response to cell stress to protect against pathological cell death in multiple diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Allison L Brill, Tom T Fischer, Jennifer M Walters, Arnaud Marlier, Lorenzo R Sewanan, Parker C Wilson, Eric K Johnson, Gilbert Moeckel, Lloyd G Cantley, Stuart G Campbell, Jeanne M Nerbonne, Hee Jung Chung, Marie E Robert, Barbara E Ehrlich<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941974">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mangosteen pericarp components alleviate progression of prostatic hyperplasia and mitochondrial dysfunction in rats.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Prostatic hyperplasia, characterized by progressive hyperplasia of glandular and stromal tissues, is the most common proliferative abnormality of the prostate in aging men. A high-fat diet (HFD) usually is a major factor inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and an abnormal state of the prostate. Mangosteen pericarp powder (MPP) has abundant xanthones which can be antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative agents. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to research whether MPP supplementation can affect the progression of prostatic hyperplasia. Twenty-four male F344 rats were randomly divided into four groups, including a control group (C), prostatic hyperplasia-induced group (P), prostatic hyperplasia-induced with low-dose MPP group (PL), and induced with high-dose MPP group (PH). The P, PL, and PH groups were given weekly intraperitoneal injections of 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) at 25 mg/kg body weight for 10 weeks, and simultaneously fed an HFD for 24 weeks. Our findings first demonstrated that MPP consumption significantly decreased the prostate weight, serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations, protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and malondialdehyde levels and ameliorated mitochondrial function in prostatic tissues. These results suggest that MPP supplementation could be used to attenuate the progression of prostatic hyperplasia.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> Hui-Hsuan Tsai, Chia-Wen Chen, Pei-Ling Yu, Yu-Ling Lin, Rong-Hong Hsieh<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941927">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Anticancer Ruthenium(III) Complexes and Ru(III)-Containing Nanoformulations: An Update on the Mechanism of Action and Biological Activity.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The great advances in the studies on metal complexes for the treatment of different cancer forms, starting from the pioneering works on platinum derivatives, have fostered an increasingly growing interest in their properties and biomedical applications. Among the various metal-containing drugs investigated thus far, ruthenium(III) complexes have emerged for their selective cytotoxic activity in vitro and promising anticancer properties in vivo, also leading to a few candidates in advanced clinical trials. Aiming at addressing the solubility, stability and cellular uptake issues of low molecular weight Ru(III)-based compounds, some research groups have proposed the development of suitable drug delivery systems (e.g., taking advantage of nanoparticles, liposomes, etc.) able to enhance their activity compared to the naked drugs. This review highlights the unique role of Ru(III) complexes in the current panorama of anticancer agents, with particular emphasis on Ru-containing nanoformulations based on the incorporation of the Ru(III) complexes into suitable nanocarriers in order to enhance their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. Preclinical evaluation of these nanoaggregates is discussed with a special focus on the investigation of their mechanism of action at a molecular level, highlighting their pharmacological potential in tumour disease models and value for biomedical applications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-28<br><b>Authors:</b> Claudia Riccardi, Domenica Musumeci, Marco Trifuoggi, Carlo Irace, Luigi Paduano, Daniela Montesarchio<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmaceuticals (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1424-8247<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.85<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.209<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561546">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Carborane-Containing Aromatic Polyimide Films with Ultrahigh Thermo-Oxidative Stability.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Carborane-containing aromatic polyimide (CPI) films with ultrahigh thermo-oxidative stability at 700 °C have been prepared by casting poly(amic acid) (PAA) resin solution on a glass surface, followed by thermal imidization at elevated temperatures. The PAA solution was prepared by copolymerization of an aromatic dianhydride and an aromatic diamine mixture, including carborane-containing aromatic diamine in an aprotic solvent. The CPI films showed excellent thermo-oxidative stability at 700 °C due to the multilayered protection layers formed on the film surface by thermal conversion of the carborane group into boron oxides. The boron oxide layer enhanced the degradation activation energy and suppressed the direct contact of inner polymer materials with oxygen molecules in a high-temperature environment, acting as a "self-healing" skin layer on the polyimide materials.

This is due, in part, to ageing, increasingly co-morbid pancreas transplant candidates. There is a paucity of published data regarding coronary artery disease (CAD) in this population. To inform peri-operative management strategies, we sought to understand the frequency of CAD among recipients of pancreas transplants at our center. Informed by these data, we sought to develop a standard protocol for evaluation. A retrospective review of pancreas transplants (solitary pancreas and simultaneous pancreas-kidney) was undertaken at the University of Maryland. Transplant outcomes and frequency of cardiac disease were analyzed. Current data were compared with historic controls. Over the study period, 59 patients underwent pancreas transplantation. Coronary architecture was assessed in 38 patients (64.4%). Discrete evidence of CAD was present in 28 of 39 patients (71.7%). All pancreas candidates (n = 21) who underwent left heart catheterization (LHC) demonstrated CAD (100%). No patients experienced myocardial infarction (MI) and no deaths resulted from cardiac disease in the early post-transplant period. Pancreas transplant candidates are at high risk for CAD. At a center in which pancreas transplant rates are increasing, a rigorous cardiac work up revealed that 71.7% of assessed recipients had CAD. Although asymptomatic, 6.8% required coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

Older adults have specific factors that may influence outcomes, one of which is delirium (acute cognitive impairment).
OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of delirium on admission in an older acute surgical population and its effect on mortality. Secondary outcomes investigated include hospital readmission and length of hospital stay.
METHOD: This observational multi-centre study investigated consecutive patients, ≥65 years, admitted to the acute surgical units of five UK hospitals during an eight-week period. On admission the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) score was performed to detect delirium. The effect of delirium on important clinical outcomes was investigated using tests of association and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 411 patients with a mean age of 77.3 years (SD 8.1). The prevalence of admission delirium was 8.8% (95% CI 6.2-11.9%) and cognitive impairment was 70.3% (95% CI 65.6-74.7%). The delirious group were not more likely to die at 30 or 90 days (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.1,

The focus of the study was the health care utilization questionnaire, asking the caregiver about the frequency of specific health care services utilization-including medication use in the last six months, on the scale from 0 to 10. Results were statistically significant for each of the healthcare service utilization when comparing caregivers to the control group. By providing adequate support and assistance in form of support groups, we can alleviate caregivers' burden and more effectively address the needs of caregivers-thereby reducing the utilization of healthcare services.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Ateequr Rahman, Rubeena Anjum, Yelena Sahakian<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmacy (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2226-4787<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554156">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Ca<br><b>Abstract:</b> Cardiac fibrosis is the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins by cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and is a hallmark feature of most heart diseases, including arrhythmia, hypertrophy, and heart failure.

ECM is comprised of numerous proteins which can be broadly classified as fibrillar (collagen types I and III) and non-fibrillar (basement membrane, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins). The basement membrane provides an interface between the cardiomyocytes and the fibrillar ECM, while proteoglycans sequester soluble growth factors and cytokines. Myocardial fibrosis was originally only linked to accumulation of fibrillar collagens, but is now recognized as the expansion of the ECM including the non-fibrillar ECM proteins. Myocardial fibrosis can be reparative to replace the lost myocardium (e.g., ischemic injury or myocardial infarction), or can be reactive resulting from pathological activity of fibroblasts (e.g., dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Contribution of fibrillar collagens to fibrosis is well studied, but the role of the non-fibrillar ECM proteins has remained less explored. In this article, we provide an overview of the contribution of the non-fibrillar components of the extracellular space of the heart to highlight the potential significance of these molecules in fibrosis, with direct evidence for some, although not all of these molecules in their direct contribution to fibrosis.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-24<br><b>Authors:</b> Michael Chute, Preetinder Aujla, Sayantan Jana, Zamaneh Kassiri<br><b>Journal:</b> J Cardiovasc Dev Dis<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2308-3425<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0.04<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547598">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> MicroRNA mediators of early life stress vulnerability to depression and suicidal behavior.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Childhood environment can have a profound impact on brain structure and function. Epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to play a critical role in adaptive and maladaptive processes by regulating gene expression without changing the genome. Over the past few years, early life stress (ELS) has been established as a major risk factor for major depression and suicidal behavior along with other psychiatric illnesses in adulthood. In recent years, the emergence of small noncoding RNAs as a mega controller of gene expression has gained attention for their role in various disease processes. Among various noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are the most studied and well characterized and have emerged as a major regulator of neural plasticity and higher brain functioning. More recently, although limited in number, studies are focusing on how miRNAs can play a role in the maladaptive processes associated with ELS both at adolescent and adult age and whether these processes are critical in developing depression and suicidal behavior. In this review, we critically evaluate how postnatal ELS relates to abnormalities in miRNA expression and functions from both animal and human literature and draw connections from these findings to depression and suicidal behavior later in life.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-19<br><b>Authors:</b> Lauren Allen, Yogesh Dwivedi<br><b>Journal:</b> Mol.

Normally, the brain unmixes the attended speech stream from the chorus of background speakers using a combination of fast temporal processing and cognitive active listening mechanisms. Of >100,000 patient records,~10% of adults visited our clinic because of reduced hearing, only to learn that their hearing was clinically normal and should not cause communication difficulties. We found that multi-talker speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely in normal hearing adults, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured with ear canal EEG recordings. Combining neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds accounted for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. The disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker speech perception identified here could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Aravindakshan Parthasarathy, Kenneth E Hancock, Kara Bennett, Victor DeGruttola, Daniel B Polley<br><b>Journal:</b> Elife<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2050-084X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 6.83<br><b>SJR:</b> 6.617<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31961322">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Investigation of Silicone-Containing Semisolid in Situ Film-Forming Systems Using QbD Tools.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The aim of our research work was to develop dermally applicable, semisolid film-forming systems (FFSs) containing silicones, which form a film on the skin in situ, with suitable mechanical properties for skin application. FFSs were developed and investigated by means of the Quality by Design (QbD) methodology. With this QbD approach, the initial risk assessment defines the critical quality attributes (CQAs), the critical material attributes (CMAs) and the critical process parameters (CPPs) to ensure the required quality. Different semisolid systems were formed with or without silicones. During the initial risk assessment, three CQAs, namely skin adhesion, film flexibility and burst strength, were found to be critical attributes, while film appearance, film integrity and the drying time of the semisolid system, were found to be medium attributes. These parameters were investigated. The initial risk assessment also showed that there are three high CMAs: the type of silicones, film-forming excipients, drying excipients, and that there was one medium CMA: viscosity-enhancing excipients. Based on our results, the silicone content had a great effect on the film-forming systems. Different silicones affected the mechanical properties of the films in varying ways, decreased the drying time and showed promising results regarding the drying mechanism.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Nikolett Kis, Anita Kovács, Mária Budai-Szűcs, Attila Gácsi, Erzsébet Csányi, Ildikó Csóka, Szilvia Berkó<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmaceutics<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1999-4923<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.74<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.091<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817871">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> PulmonDB: a curated lung disease gene expression database.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) have contrasting clinical and pathological characteristics and interesting whole-genome transcriptomic profiles.

Haematoxylin-eosin staining showed that hair follicles were in the telogen phase in the first week, while they were in the anagen phase from the fourth to twenty-fourth weeks. In addition, two small RNA libraries derived from skin samples of Wan Strain Angora rabbits at telogen and anagen stages yielded over 24 million high-quality reads. Specifically, 185 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the telogen and anagen phases. The function of the differentially expressed miRNAs was explored by comparing them with known mammalian miRNAs and by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of their predicted targets. Five new functional miRNAs were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, the fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene was verified to be a target of conservative_NC_013672.1_9290 and conservative_NC_013675.1_10734.

The nanohybrid system was prepared with various concentrations of each component. Resistance of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was compared in the presence of individual Nano and Bio counterparts as well as the nanohybrid system. Upon interaction of SeNPs with Lysozyme, the nanohybrid system efficiently enhanced the antibacterial activity compared to the protein. Therefore, SeNPs play an important role in inhibition of bacterial growth at very low concentrations of protein; whereas very high amount of the protein is required to inhibit bacterial growth individually. On the other hand, lysozyme has also played a vital role in antibacterial property of SeNPs, inducing 100% inhibition at very low concentration of each component. Hence, presence of both nano and bio counterparts induced vital interplay in the Nanohybrid system. The aged samples also presented good stability of SeNPs both as the intact and complex form. Results of this effort highlight design of nanohybrid systems with synergistic antibacterial properties to overcome the emerging antibiotic resistance as well as to define fruitful applications in biomedicine and food safety.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Mahsa Vahdati, Tahereh Tohidi Moghadam<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949299">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy Study of Carbon-Vacancy Interaction in Low-Temperature Bainite.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Nano-scale investigations of bainitic structures formed at temperatures below 350 °C have shown that the bainitic ferrite lattice is super-saturated in carbon.

A predictive tool to indicate support (or lack of) for biological findings may aid clinical translation of therapies. We created a Boolean model of RVD and hypothesized that it would predict outcomes observed in our previous studies using a translational swine model of RVD. Our studies have focused on developing treatments to halt renal microvascular (MV) rarefaction in RVD, a major feature of renal injury. A network topology of 20 factors involved in renal MV rarefaction that allowed simulation of 5 previously tested treatments was created. Each factor was assigned a function based upon its interactions with other variables and assumed to be "on" or "off". Simulations of interventions were performed until outcomes reached a steady state and analyzed to determine pathological processes that were activated, inactivated, or unchanged vs. RVD with no intervention. Boolean simulations mimicked the results of our previous studies, confirming the importance of MV integrity on treatment outcomes in RVD. Furthermore, our study supports the potential application of a mathematical tool to predict therapeutic feasibility, which may guide the design of future studies for RVD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-17<br><b>Authors:</b> Erika Williams, Alejandro R Chade<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949240">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Association between lifetime coffee consumption and late life cerebral white matter hyperintensities in cognitively normal elderly individuals.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Coffee consumption is associated with cerebral hypoperfusion that may contribute to the development of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH).

Understanding this enigmatic relationship between bats and emerging zoonotic viruses requires tools and approaches which enable the comparative study of bat immune cell populations and their functions. We show that bat genomes have a conservation of immune marker genes which delineate phagocyte populations in humans, while lacking key mouse surface markers such as Ly6C and Ly6G. Cross-reactive antibodies against CD44, CD11b, CD14, MHC II, and CD206 were multiplexed to characterize circulating monocytes, granulocytes, bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and lung alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the cave nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea. Transcriptional profiling of bat monocytes and BMDMs identified additional markers - including MARCO, CD68, CD163, CD172α, and CD88 - which can be used to further characterize bat myeloid populations. Bat cells often resembled their human counterparts when comparing immune parameters that are divergent between humans and mice, such as the expression patterns of certain immune cell markers. A genome-wide comparison of immune-related genes also revealed a much closer phylogenetic relationship between bats and humans compared to rodents.

However, the relatively low yield strength limits its application in high strength structural applications. Cryorolling is one of the promising methods of enhancing the mechanical properties of sheet metals. In the present work, Cryorolling of UNS S31000 stainless steel resulted in five-fold enhancement in yield strength with a significant loss in ductility. However, flash annealing at 800 °C for 120 s could restore its ductility up to 50% of its original ductility. The enhancement in strength is attributed to the formation of deformation nano-twins during flash annealing along with a bimodal grain structure.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2020-01-16<br><b>Authors:</b> G Venkata Sarath Kumar, K R Mangipudi, G V S Sastry, Lalit Kumar Singh, S Dhanasekaran, K Sivaprasad<br><b>Journal:</b> Sci Rep<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2045-2322<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 4.12<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.414<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31941948">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dimensions of Impulsivity in Gambling Disorder.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct.

We first aimed to examine whether associations between three facets of impulsivity (response impulsivity, choice impulsivity and impulsive tendency) varied between GD patients and healthy controls (HC). We next aimed to evaluate relationships between these three types of impulsivity, as proposed by theoretical models of impulsivity, and their associations with GD severity. The sample included 97 treatment-seeking adult men with GD, diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria, and 32 male HCs recruited from the general population. Greater impulsivity in all three domains was found in men with GD in comparison to men without GD. Associations between impulsivity facets were found in both groups, with response impulsivity being the only domain associated with GD severity. Our findings confirm that multiple domains of impulsivity are relevant in GD.

While the literature is abundant on the therapeutic management of meningioma recurrence after the initial surgery, the natural history of repeated recurrences is poorly described, as well as and their respective management. A partly retrospective, partly prospective review was conducted in a Norwegian cohort of 1469 consecutive cases of meningioma surgically treated, totaling 11 414 patient-years of follow-up. 114 recurrences (7.7%) were treated surgically with a risk a surgical retreatment of 1% per patient-year of follow-up. 36 patients were operated on 3 times or more. The time-to-retreatment (TTR) decreased significantly and steadily between surgeries, from 4.3 ± 4 years after the first surgery to 2.4 ± 2.9 years after the third surgery. The primary driver for recurrence was the WHO grade (OR 7.13 [4.40;11.55], p < 0.001 for the first recurrence and OR 4.13 [1.49;12.15], p 0.008 for the second), the second predictive factor being a skull base location (OR 2.76 [1.95;3.99] p < 0.001 and OR 0.24 [0.09;0.65], p0.006 respectively). The rates of postoperative hematomas and infections were not influenced by the number of surgeries, whereas the rate of postoperative neurological worsening increased from 3.9% to 16.6% and 13.9%, respectively, after the first, second, and third surgeries. We observed that the TTR decreased significantly between surgeries in patients requiring repeated resections, indicating that surgical treatment of recurrences does not reset the clock but is indeed a "race against time".

Soot aggregates collected from air monitoring stations in different locations were examined. The locations were divided into three groups. The first group (Case 1) included the coastal and industrial zone; the second group (Case 2) consisted of small and large cities; and the third group (Case 3) included areas in the neighbourhood of thermal power plants. The absorbance measurements of the soot aggregates were conducted in the visible and near-infrared spectra, and in the wavelength range of 2 μm-20 μm. The samples were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and their radiative properties were assessed using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) for numerically generated fractal aggregates with two popular refractive indices of m = 1.60 + 0.60i and m = 1.90 + 0.75i.

We detected the formation of acrylamide adducts with thiol groups from both metabolites and protein residues, leading to a quasi-complete depletion of glutathione and to the inactivation of different components of the thioredoxin system. We propose that the combined loss-of-function of both redox metabolism-related systems configure a perfect storm that explains many acrylamide neurotoxic effects, like the dysregulation of genes related to microtubules, presynaptic vesicle alteration, and behavioral alterations.

Currently available drugs and vaccines only partially reduce deaths and hospitalizations. Some of the reasons for this disturbing situation stem from the sophistication of the viral machinery, but another reason is the lack of a complete understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of viral infections and host-pathogen interactions. Even the functions of the influenza proteins, their mechanisms of action and interaction with host proteins have not been fully revealed. These questions have traditionally been studied in mammalian animal models, mainly ferrets and mice (as well as pigs and non-human primates) and in cell lines. Although obviously relevant as models to humans, these experimental systems are very complex and are not conveniently accessible to various genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches. The fact that influenza remains an unsolved problem, in combination with the limitations of the conventional experimental models, motivated increasing attempts to use the power of other models, such as low eukaryotes, including invertebrate, and primary cell cultures.

An Update and Links with Iron.<br><b>Abstract:</b> This review provides a synopsis of the published literature over the past two years on the heme-binding protein hemopexin (HPX), with some background information on the biochemistry of the HPX system. One focus is on the mechanisms of heme-driven pathology in the context of heme and iron homeostasis in human health and disease. The heme-binding protein hemopexin is a multi-functional protectant against hemoglobin (Hb)-derived heme toxicity as well as mitigating heme-mediated effects on immune cells, endothelial cells, and stem cells that collectively contribute to driving inflammation, perturbing vascular hemostasis and blood-brain barrier function. Heme toxicity, which may lead to iron toxicity, is recognized increasingly in a wide range of conditions involving hemolysis and immune system activation and, in this review, we highlight some newly identified actions of heme and hemopexin especially in situations where normal processes fail to maintain heme and iron homeostasis. Finally, we present preliminary data showing that the cytokine IL-6 cross talks with activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in response to heme-hemopexin in models of hepatocytes. This indicates another level of complexity in the cell responses to elevated heme via the HPX system when the immune system is activated and/or in the presence of inflammation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-09-26<br><b>Authors:</b> Luis Montecinos, Jeffrey D Eskew, Ann Smith<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmaceuticals (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1424-8247<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.85<br><b>SJR:</b> 1.209<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554244">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Pseudo-Online BMI Based on EEG to Detect the Appearance of Sudden Obstacles during Walking.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The aim of this paper is to describe new methods for detecting the appearance of unexpected obstacles during normal gait from EEG signals, improving the accuracy and reducing the false positive rate obtained in previous studies.

The main drawbacks of a paper substrate for a SERS sensor are its high porosity, inherent hygroscopic nature, and hydrophilic surface property, which reduce the sensitivity and reproducibility of the SERS sensor. Here, we propose a simple, quick, convenient, and economical method for hydrophilic to hydrophobic surface modification of paper, while enhancing its mechanical and moisture-resistant properties. The hydrophobic paper (h-paper) was obtained by spin-coating diluted polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution onto the filter paper, resulting in h-paper with an increased contact angle of up to ≈130°. To complete the h-paper-based SERS substrate, gold nanoparticles arranged on graphene oxide (AuNPs@GO) were synthesized using UV photoreduction, followed by drop-casting of AuNPs@GO solution on the h-paper substrate. The enhancement of the SERS signal was then assessed by attaching a rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecule as a Raman probe material to the h-paper-based SERS substrate.

Most degradation processes relevant to this material, e.g., corrosion, are related to an increased level of material moisture. Therefore, moisture monitoring in reinforced concrete is regarded as a crucial method for structural health monitoring. In this study, passive radio frequency identification (RFID)-based sensors are embedded into the concrete. They are well suited for long-term operation over decades and are well protected against harsh environmental conditions. The energy supply and the data transfer of the humidity sensors are provided by RFID. The sensor casing materials are optimised to withstand the high alkaline environment in concrete, having pH values of more than 12. Membrane materials are also investigated to identify materials capable of enabling water vapour transport from the porous cement matrix to the embedded humidity sensor. By measuring the corresponding relative humidity with embedded passive RFID-based sensors, the cement hydration is monitored for 170 days. Moreover, long-term moisture monitoring is performed for more than 1000 days. The experiments show that embedded passive RFID-based sensors are highly suitable for long-term structural health monitoring in civil engineering.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Christoph Strangfeld, Sergej Johann, Matthias Bartholmai<br><b>Journal:</b> Sensors (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 1424-8220<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.51<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.592<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31847193">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Development of Ultrasonic Guided Wave Transducer for Monitoring of High Temperature Pipelines.<br><b>Abstract:</b> High-temperature (HT) ultrasonic transducers are of increasing interest for structural health monitoring (SHM) of structures operating in harsh environments.

To unravel the complexity of the clinical phenotype-genotype network, we used cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (i.e. miRNAs, long ncRNAs, etc.) as the case for the study of CVDs at a systems or network level. We first integrated a database of CVDs and ncRNAs (CVDncR, http://sysbio.org.cn/cvdncr/) to construct CVD-ncRNA networks and annotate their clinical associations. To characterize the networks, we then separated the miRNAs into two groups, i.e. universal miRNAs associated with at least two types of CVDs and specific miRNAs related only to one type of CVD. Our analyses indicated two interesting patterns in these CVD-ncRNA networks. First, scale-free features were present within both CVD-miRNA and CVD-lncRNA networks; second, universal miRNAs were more likely to be CVDs biomarkers. These results were confirmed by computational functional analyses. The findings offer theoretical guidance for decoding CVD-ncRNA associations and will facilitate the screening of CVD ncRNA biomarkers.

The shape memory performance is characterized in terms of the shape fixity ratio (after up to one year of storage) and shape recovery ratio (upon heating to previous programming temperature). Programming in the mode of uniaxial tension is carried out at a temperature within the glass transition range to one of four prescribed programming strains (namely 10%, 20%, 40% and 80%). Also investigated is the residual strain after heating for shape recovery. The characterization of the mechanical behavior of programmed samples after storage for up to three months is via cyclic uniaxial tensile test.

A comprehensive study of nanocomposites, comprising non-treated and surface treated barium titanate (BTO), embedded within an epoxy matrix, was performed. The surface treatments were performed with two types of coupling agents: Ethanol and 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilan. The observations of particle agglomeration, piezoelectric strain coefficients, and resistivity were compared, where the most ideal properties were found for concentrations of 0.02 and 0.025. This work demonstrates that the interfacial core-shell processing layer concentration influences the macroscopic properties of nanocomposites, and the opportunities for tuning interfacial layers for desirable characteristics of specific applications.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-21<br><b>Authors:</b> Udhay Sundar, Zichen Lao, Kimberly Cook-Chennault<br><b>Journal:</b> Polymers (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4360<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.13<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.724<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31861188">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Study of the Influence of the Reprocessing Cycles on the Final Properties of Polylactide Pieces Obtained by Injection Molding.<br><b>Abstract:</b> This research work aims to study the influence of the reprocessing cycles on the mechanical, thermal, and thermomechanical properties of polylactide (PLA). To this end, PLA was subjected to as many as six extrusion cycles and the resultant pellets were shaped into pieces by injection molding. Mechanical characterization revealed that the PLA pieces presented relatively similar properties up to the third reprocessing cycle, whereas further cycles induced an intense reduction in ductility and toughness. The effect of the reprocessing cycles was also studied by the changes in the melt fluidity, which showed a significant increase after four reprocessing cycles. An increase in the bio-polyester chain mobility was also attained with the number of the reprocessing cycles that subsequently favored an increase in crystallinity of PLA. A visual inspection indicated that PLA developed certain yellowing and the pieces also became less transparent with the increasing number of reprocessing cycles. Therefore, the obtained results showed that PLA suffers a slight degradation after one or two reprocessing cycles whereas performance impairment becomes more evident above the fourth reprocessing cycle. This finding suggests that the mechanical recycling of PLA for up to three cycles of extrusion and subsequent injection molding is technically feasible.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Angel Agüero, Maria Del Carmen Morcillo, Luis Quiles-Carrillo, Rafael Balart, Teodomiro Boronat, Diego Lascano, Sergio Torres-Giner, Octavio Fenollar<br><b>Journal:</b> Polymers (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2073-4360<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 3.13<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.724<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31756897">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficacy of Verbally Describing One's Own Body Movement in Motor Skill Acquisition.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present study examined whether (a) verbally describing one's own body movement can be potentially effective for acquiring motor skills, and (b) if the effects are related to motor imagery. The participants in this study were 36 healthy young adults (21.2 ± 0.7 years), randomly assigned into two groups (describing and control). They performed a ball rotation activity, with the describing group being asked by the examiner to verbally describe their own ball rotation, while the control group was asked to read a magazine aloud. The participants' ball rotation performances were measured before the intervention, then again immediately after, five minutes after, and one day after. In addition, participants' motor imagery ability (mental chronometry) of their upper extremities was measured. The results showed that the number of successful ball rotations (motor smoothness) and the number of ball drops (motor error) significantly improved in the describing group. Moreover, improvement in motor skills had a significant correlation with motor imagery ability. This suggests that verbally describing an intervention is an effective tool for learning motor skills, and that motor imagery is a potential mechanism for such verbal descriptions.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-10<br><b>Authors:</b> Tsubasa Kawasaki, Masashi Kono, Ryosuke Tozawa<br><b>Journal:</b> Brain Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2076-3425<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 2.93<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.976<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817257">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Development, Cytotoxicity and Eye Irritation Profile of a New Sunscreen Formulation Based on Benzophenone-3-poly(ε-caprolactone) Nanocapsules.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The objective of this work was to characterize the toxicological profile of a newly developed sunscreen formulation based on polymeric nanocapsules (NCs) loading benzophenone-3 (BZP3).

During a dog's life, the immune system needs to adapt to different physiological conditions, assuring surveillance and protection in a careful and controlled way. Pregnancy alters normal homeostasis, requiring a balance between immunity and tolerance. The embryos and fetus should be protected from infections, while the female dog must tolerate the growing of semi-allografts in her uterus. After birth, newborn puppies are at great risk of developing infectious diseases, because their immune system is in development and immune memory is absent. Passive transfer of immunity through colostrum is fundamental for puppy survival in the first weeks of life, but hampers the development of an active immune response to vaccination. At the end of life, dogs experience a decline in the structure and functional competence of the immune system, compromising the immune responses to novel antigenic challenges, such as infections and vaccines. Therefore, the current article reviews the general processes related to the development of the dog´s immune system, providing an overview of immune activity throughout the dog's life and its implications in canine health, and highlighting priority research goals.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-23<br><b>Authors:</b> Maria Pereira, Ana Valério-Bolas, Cátia Saraiva-Marques, Graça Alexandre-Pires, Isabel Pereira da Fonseca, Gabriela Santos-Gomes<br><b>Journal:</b> Vet Sci<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2306-7381<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 1.42<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.483<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640234">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Case Reports for Topical Treatment of Corneal Ulcers with a New Matrix Therapy Agent or RGTA<br><b>Abstract:</b> Superficial corneal ulcers that fail to heal within a normal time period and are refractory to conventional therapy in dogs are common in veterinary practice.

Few studies have examined clinicopathologic correlations between phosphorylated-tau neurofibrillary tangles, β-amyloid neuritic plaques, neuroinflammation, or white matter (WM) lesions, and neuropsychiatric disorders in veterans. We describe clinicopathologic findings in 4 military veterans with early-onset dementia (EOD) who had varying histories of blunt- and blast-TBI, cognitive decline, behavioral abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, and suicide. We found that pathologic lesions in these military-EOD cases could not be categorized as classic Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy, traumatic axonal injury, or other well-characterized clinicopathologic entities. Rather, we observed a mixture of polypathology with unusual patterns compared with pathologies found in AD or other dementias. Also, ultrahigh resolution ex vivo MRI in 2 of these 4 brains revealed unusual patterns of periventricular WM injury. These findings suggest that military-EOD cases are associated with atypical combinations of brain lesions and distribution rarely seen in nonmilitary populations. Future prospective studies that acquire neuropsychiatric data before and after deployments, as well as genetic and environmental exposure data, are needed to further elucidate clinicopathologic correlations in military-EOD.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-18<br><b>Authors:</b> Diego Iacono, Patricia Lee, Brian L Edlow, Nichelle Gray, Bruce Fischl, Kimbra Kenney, Henry L Lew, Scott Lozanoff, Peter Liacouras, John Lichtenberger, Kristen Dams-O'Connor, David Cifu, Sidney R Hinds, Daniel P Perl<br><b>Journal:</b> J.

Intraneuronal tau pathology progresses from the temporal transentorhinal and entorhinal regions into neocortical fields/areas of the temporal allocortex. Here, based on 95 cases staged for AD-related neurofibrillary changes, we propose an ordered progression of abnormal tau in the temporal allocortex. Initially, abnormal tau was limited to distal dendritic segments followed by tau in cell bodies of projection neurons of the transentorhinal/entorhinal layer pre-α. Next, abnormal distal dendrites accumulated in the prosubiculum and extended into the CA1 stratum oriens and lacunosum. Subsequently, altered dendrites developed in the CA2/CA3 stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum-moleculare, combined with tau-positive thorny excrescences of CA3/CA4 mossy cells. Finally, granule cells of the dentate fascia became involved. Such a progression might recapitulate a sequence of transsynaptic spreading of abnormal tau from 1 projection neuron to the next: From pre-α cells to distal dendrites in the prosubiculum and CA1; then, from CA1 or prosubicular pyramids to CA2 principal cells and CA3/CA4 mossy cells; finally, from CA4 mossy cells to dentate granule cells.

The coronal part was embedded in the core build-up materials and the specimens were loaded under tensile force up to failure. The reliability (β) and characteristic life (σο, in Ν) of the debonding force were evaluated by Weibull statistics and the debonded specimens were subjected to failure mode analysis. The results showed that ARL, MPT posts were the most and GLX the least retentive, despite the core build-up material used. CPC provided the highest retention with four posts (FBK, GLX, MTP, and PRW), without statistically significant differences from CDC in two (FBK and MTP) and CNB in one (PRW). CPC and CDC were the most reliable core materials for two posts (ARL and PRW), with no statistically significant difference from CNB in three (FBK, GLX, and MTP). GLX and PRW demonstrated the highest (93%) incidence of post detachment from core, whereas FBK demonstrated the highest percentage of core material fracture, with most fractures occurring in CDC (57%).

METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study conducted at the five daycare centers located in the city's district of most socioeconomic vulnerability. The study included 326 preschool children (17 to 63 months old) from both genders. The dependent variable was the conditional weight gain (CWG), that represents how much a child, according to their gender, deviated from their peers in relation to the expected weight gain, given sample's birthweight, gender, and age at the survey. Univariate tests (t-test and analysis of variance) were used to compare CWG means according to environmental and biological factors, considering the independent variables with p<0.20 as electable for the multiple linear regression model. In the final model, variables with p<0.05 or that contributed to the model adjustment were kept.
RESULTS: Children's mean age was 45.4±9.9 months, and 53.4% of the sample consisted of boys. The prevalence of overweight was 7%. In the multivariable linear regression model, it was possible to identify that the following factors were associated with excessive weight gain among preschool children: less than six prenatal care visits (0.36 SD [95%CI 0.13-0.60]), not rooming-in in the postpartum period (0.30 SD [95%CI 0.03-0.58]), and never breastfed (0.44 SD [95%CI 0.06-0.81]).

Thus, early diagnosis and targeted systemic antifungal treatment remains the most important predictive factor for a successful outcome in immunocompromised individuals with invasive mold infections. Diagnosis remains difficult due to low sensitivities of diagnostic tests including culture and other mycological tests for mold pathogens, particularly in patients on mold-active antifungal prophylaxis. As a result, antifungal treatment is rarely targeted and reliable markers for treatment monitoring and outcome prediction are missing. Thus, there is a need for improved markers to diagnose invasive mold infections, monitor response to treatment, and assist in determining when antifungal therapy should be escalated, switched, or can be stopped. This review focuses on the role of immunologic markers and specifically cytokines in diagnosis and treatment monitoring of invasive mold infections.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-31<br><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey D Jenks, Stephen A Rawlings, Carol Garcia-Vidal, Philipp Koehler, Toine Mercier, Juergen Prattes, Cornelia Lass-Flörl, M Teresa Martin-Gomez, Dieter Buchheidt, Livio Pagano, Jean-Pierre Gangneux, Frank L van de Veerdonk, Mihai G Netea, Agostinho Carvalho, Martin Hoenigl<br><b>Journal:</b> J Fungi (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2309-608X<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31888227">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> The Dysbiosis and Inter-Kingdom Synergy Model in Oropharyngeal Candidiasis, a New Perspective in Pathogenesis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> As more information emerges on oral microbiota using advanced sequencing methodologies, it is imperative to examine how organisms modulate the capacity of each other to colonize or trigger infection.

The 146,710 individuals used an average of 12 (SD 7) different medications, mostly cardiovascular (91.3% of users), hormones, including hypoglycemic agents (84.5%), and central nervous system medications (79.8%). The majority of individuals (59%) were exposed to the combination of treatments and the factor most strongly associated was the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities (RR: 1.29; 99% CI: 1.28-1.31). Older individuals with diabetes are exposed to a large number of medications. While the use of the combination of treatments is significant and could translate into cardiovascular benefits at the population level, the potential risk associated with polypharmacy needs to be documented.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-06<br><b>Authors:</b> Marie-Eve Gagnon, Caroline Sirois, Marc Simard, Céline Plante<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmacy (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2226-4787<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31805662">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Impact of Diabetes Perceptions on Medication Adherence in Japan.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-01<br><b>Authors:</b> Koki Urata, Kana Hashimoto, Reiko Horiuchi, Kiichi Fukui, Kunizo Arai<br><b>Journal:</b> Pharmacy (Basel)<br><b>ISSN:</b> 2226-4787<br><b>Relevance score 1:</b> 0.14<br><b>Relevance score 2:</b> 0<br><b>Two-year IF:</b> 0.0<br><b>SJR:</b> 0.0<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671762">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unknown -

A protein-reactive electrophilic group such as an epoxyketone, an aziridinylketone, or a beta-lactone is attached to the C-terminal amino acid. Upon contact with a proteasome complex in a target cell, the electrophilic group reacts with a functional group in or near a binding pocket or active site of the proteasome, forming a covalent bond and thereby inactivating the proteasome. These and other proteasome inhibitors can be screened for binding affinity and an ability to selectively eliminate senescent cells or cancer cells.
