Major emphasis was given to the quality and quantities of regenerative products, but recent evidence points to the importance of a better specification of the target population that may take advantage of these advanced medical treatments. Patient stratification is an important step in drug development. Tailoring treatment to the patient's specificity allowed significant improvement in cancer therapy, but personalized regenerative medicine is still at the initial stage in the cardiovascular field. For example, new-borns with a congenital heart condition and elderly people require dedicated therapeutic approaches, which adapt to their lifetime needs. In these people, personalized treatments may overcome the benefits delivered by standard protocols. In this review, we provide insights into these extreme stages of life as potential targets for cardiovascular reconstitution.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828079">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mesenchymal stem cell perspective: cell biology to clinical progress.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The terms MSC and MSCs have become the preferred acronym to describe a cell and a cell population of multipotential stem/progenitor cells commonly referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, multipotential stromal cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, and mesenchymal progenitor cells. The MSCs can differentiate to important lineages under defined conditions in vitro and in limited situations after implantation in vivo. MSCs were isolated and described about 30 years ago and now there are over 55,000 publications on MSCs readily available. Here, we have focused on human MSCs whenever possible. The MSCs have broad anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties. At present, these provide the greatest focus of human MSCs in clinical testing; however, the properties of cultured MSCs in vitro suggest they can have broader applications. The medical utility of MSCs continues to be investigated in over 950 clinical trials. There has been much progress in understanding MSCs over the years, and there is a strong foundation for future scientific research and clinical applications, but also some important questions remain to be answered. Developing further methods to understand and unlock MSC potential through intracellular and intercellular signaling, biomedical engineering, delivery methods and patient selection should all provide substantial advancements in the coming years and greater clinical opportunities. The expansive and growing field of MSC research is teaching us basic human cell biology as well as how to use this type of cell for cellular therapy in a variety of clinical settings, and while much promise is evident, careful new work is still needed.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31815001">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mechanisms supporting potential use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in psychocardiology.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Despite great efforts made in recent years, globally cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common and devastating disease. Pharmacological, interventional and surgical treatments have proved to be only partly satisfactory for the majority of patients. A major underlying cause of poor prognosis is a high comorbidity rate between CVD and mental illness, which calls for the approaches of psychocardiology. As psychiatric disorders and CVD can influence each other bidirectionally, it is necessary to develop novel therapies targeting both systems simultaneously. Therefore, innovative stem cell (SC) therapy has become the most promising treatment strategy in psychocardiology. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs), among all different types of SCs, have drawn the most attention due to unique advantages in terms of ethical considerations, low immunogenicity and simplicity of preparation. In this review, we survey recent publications and clinical trials to summarize the knowledge and progress gained so far. Moreover, we discuss the feasibility of the clinical application of BM-MSCs in the area of psychocardiology.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-09<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31814884">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> None<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: While regenerative stem cell therapy for ischemic heart disease has moved into phase 3 studies, little is still known about retention and migration of cell posttransplantation. In human studies, the ability to track transplanted cells has been limited to labeling with radioisotopes and tracking using nuclear imaging. This method is limited by low resolution and short half-lives of available radioisotopes. Longitudinal tracking using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of myocardial injected cells labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles has shown promising results in numerous preclinical studies but has yet to be evaluated in human studies. We aimed to evaluate MRI tracking of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) labeled with ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles after intramyocardial transplantation in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD).
Methods: Five no-option patients with chronic symptomatic IHD underwent NOGA-guided intramyocardial transplantation of USPIO-labeled MSCs. Serial MRI scans were performed to track labeled cells both visually and using semiautomated T2∗ relaxation time analysis. For safety, we followed symptoms, quality of life, and myocardial function for 6 months.
Results: USPIO-labeled MSCs were tracked for up to 14 days after transplantation at injection sites both visually and using semiautomated regional T2∗ relaxation time analysis. Labeling of MSCs did not impair long-term safety of treatment.
Conclusion: This was a first-in-man clinical experience aimed at evaluating the utility of MRI tracking of USPIO-labeled bone marrow-derived autologous MSCs after intramyocardial injection in patients with chronic IHD. The treatment was safe, and cells were detectable at injection sites up to 14 days after transplantation. Further studies are needed to clarify if MSCs migrate out of the injection area into other areas of the myocardium or if injected cells are washed out into the peripheral circulation.

It starts beating in the first few weeks of embryonic life and keeps pumping blood till death. This organ can host a range of diseases as well. Some can hamper the vasculature, while others can affect its electrical activity, the heart valves, etc. All these conditions can lead to end-stage failure where it can no longer meet the requirements of the body's milieu. This imbalance between supply and demand leads to an array of symptoms. Medical management can reduce these clinical effects and possibly prolong the life expectancy in such patients. However, prescription medications can also have their own adverse effects. This necessitates that each line of treatment should be assessed on a risk vs benefit basis. The conventional approach has been to try and slow down the progression of heart failure (HF). However, the inception of stem cells in the management of HF has the potential for reversal of this pathology. Keeping this in view, many studies and trials are under process. To turn the clock back on the HF, before complications set in or get out of control, is the main focus of the time. This article attempts to evaluate various studies about stem cell therapy (SCT) and highlight the important aspects of this novel modality in changing patients' lives.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-12-05<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803548">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Complementary Embryonic and Adult Cell Populations Enhance Myocardial Repair in Rat Myocardial Injury Model.<br><b>Abstract:</b> We compared the functional outcome of Isl-1<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-29<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781239">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Combining ECM Hydrogels of Cardiac Bioactivity with Stem Cells of High Cardiomyogenic Potential for Myocardial Repair.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Tissue engineering exploring the combination of scaffolds and seeding cells was proposed as a promising strategy for myocardial repair.

Regenerative medicine relies mainly on the therapeutic potential of stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their immunosuppressive properties and tissue repair abilities, seem to be an ideal tool for cell-based therapies. Taking into account all available sources of MSCs, perinatal tissues become an attractive source of allogeneic MSCs. The allogeneic MSCs provide "off-the-shelf" cellular therapy, however, their allogenicity may be viewed as a limitation for their use. Moreover, some evidence suggests that MSCs are not as immune-privileged as it was previously reported. Therefore, understanding their interactions with the recipient's immune system is crucial for their successful clinical application. In this review, we discuss both autologous and allogeneic application of MSCs, focusing on current approaches to allogeneic MSCs therapies, with a particular interest in the role of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and HLA-matching in allogeneic MSCs transplantation. Importantly, the evidence from the currently completed and ongoing clinical trials demonstrates that allogeneic MSCs transplantation is safe and seems to cause no major side-effects to the patient. These findings strongly support the case for MSCs efficacy in treatment of a variety of diseases and their use as an "off-the-shelf" medical product.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766164">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> CD51 distinguishes a subpopulation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with distinct migratory potential: a novel cell-based strategy to treat acute myocardial infarction in mice.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Experimental and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficiency of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (bMSCs) in the treatment of myocardial infarction. However, after intravenous injection, the ineffective migration of engrafted bMSCs to the hearts remains an obstacle, which has an undesirable impact on the efficiency of cell-based therapy.

Current therapeutic approaches for OA are not curative and only temporarily alleviate symptoms. In recent years, pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) related therapy is a promising option for the treatment of cartilage lesions and OA. MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BMSCs) have been widely used in animal models and clinic practice to demonstrate their chondrogenic potential, however the incidence of BMSC donors is low. Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) are a more easily accessible source of stem cells for OA treatment. MSC related therapies for cartilage lesions and OA include tissue engineering of MSC transplantation, scaffold-free injection of stem cells and cell-free injection of exosomes into the injured joints. Although a great deal of effort is required at the basic and clinical research fronts, the promise is that improved cell-based therapies will ultimately lead to the repair of damaged or diseased joints, and MSC exosome therapy for OA could be a safer, cheaper and a more effective treatment modality. MSC related therapy is predicted to become a regular and routine regenerative medicine for OA treatment in future clinical practice.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-18<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31737182">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Unmodified autologous stem cells at point of care for chronic myocardial infarction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Numerous studies investigated cell-based therapies for myocardial infarction (MI). The conflicting results of these studies have established the need for developing innovative approaches for applying cell-based therapy for MI. Experimental studies on animal models demonstrated the potential of fresh, uncultured, unmodified, autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (UA-ADRCs) for treating acute MI. In contrast, studies on the treatment of chronic MI (CMI; > 4 wk post-MI) with UA-ADRCs have not been published so far. Among several methods for delivering cells to the myocardium, retrograde delivery into a temporarily blocked coronary vein has recently been demonstrated as an effective option.
AIM: To test the hypothesis that in experimentally-induced chronic myocardial infarction (CMI; > 4 wk post-MI) in pigs, retrograde delivery of fresh, uncultured, unmodified, autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (UA-ADRCs) into a temporarily blocked coronary vein improves cardiac function and structure.
METHODS: The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery of pigs was blocked for 180 min at time point T0. Then, either 18 × 10
RESULTS: Unlike the delivery of saline, delivery of UA-ADRCs demonstrated statistically significant improvements in cardiac function and structure at T2 compared to T1 (all values given as mean ± SE): Increased mean LVEF (UA-ADRCs group: 34.3% ± 2.9% at T1 
CONCLUSION: Retrograde cell delivery of UA-ADRCs in a porcine model for the study of CMI significantly improved myocardial function, increased myocardial mass and reduced the formation of scar tissue.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692971">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Efficacy and Safety of Stem Cell Therapy in Advanced Heart Failure Patients: A Systematic Review with a Meta-analysis of Recent Trials Between 2017 and 2019.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Objective The effects of stem cell therapy in patients with advanced heart failure is an ongoing debate. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of stem cell therapy plus the standard of care as compared to the placebo plus the standard of care in advanced heart failure patients. Methods A comprehensive keyword search of PubMed between 2017 and 2019 was performed to extract trials conducted with stem cell therapy controlled with placebo in advanced heart failure. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with data on safety and efficacy in patients with advanced heart failure after stem cell transplantation. Results Six RCTs, consisting of 569 patients, were selected. Three-hundred sixty-seven (367) out of 369 participants from the eligible four out of six RCTs were included for efficacy analysis, as we lost two patients from the final analysis due to early death. Five-hundred twenty-six (526) out of 527 participants from the eligible five out of six RCTs were included for safety analysis, as we lost one patient from the final analysis for not being able to receive the intervention. Stem cell transplantation significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 4.58% (95% CI: 3.73-5.43%; p = 0.00001), improved left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) by -5.18 ml (95% CI: -9.74 to -0.63 ml; p =0.03), and there was no difference in the risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.78%; p = 0.91). The above results correlate with the previous meta-analysis data conducted in 2016. Conclusions This meta-analysis provided the cumulative efficacy and safety results of stem cell transplantation in advanced heart failure based on recent RCTs. The above results suggest that stem cell therapy was associated with a moderate improvement in LVEF, and the safety analysis indicates no increased risk of mortality in patients with advanced heart failure. This meta-analysis recommends conducting more RCTs comparing stem cell transplantation and placebo with a larger patient population and longer follow-up.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-11-06<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696004">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Genetic determinants of responsiveness to mesenchymal stem cell injections in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) responds variably to intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We hypothesized that NIDCM genotype may influence responsiveness to MSC therapy and performed genotyping on all patients in the POSEIDON-DCM trial.
METHODS: POSEIDON-DCM patients (n = 34) underwent genetic sequence analysis and deletion/duplication testing. The results were classified as positive for pathological variants (PV+; n = 8), negative for any variants (V-; n = 6), or as variants of uncertain significance (VUS; n = 20). All outcomes of therapy were analysed for each category of genetic results.
FINDINGS: The 3 groups were indistinguishable at baseline with regard to ejection fraction (EF), demographics, medication use, or functional parameters. V- patients had an increase in EF at 12 months: +13.6% (IQR = +7.8%; +20.5%; p = 0.002), compared with VUS (+6.5%; IQR = +0.9%, +11.1%; p = 0.005) and PV+(-5.9%; IQR = -12.7%, +1.0; p = 0.2; p = 0.01 between groups). Six-minute walk distance improved in V- patients, but not in VUS and PV+. V- patients improved MLHFQ, compared to the other 2 groups, which did not improve over time. EPCCFUs increased by 9.7 ± 1.9 in V- (p = 0.009) compared to VUS and PV+ patients. V- patients had one-year survival (100%) compared with VUS (85%) and PV+ (40%; p = 0.015 log-rank). Similarly, MACE rates were lower in V- (0%) than PV+ (61.9%) or VUS (42.2%; p = 0.021 log-rank).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings support the concept that the genetic profile of NIDCM patients plays a role in responsiveness to MSC therapy, with V- patients more likely to benefit and the converse for PV+. This observation emphasizes the need for further genetic studies, because of important implications for the management of NIDCM syndromes.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-10-27<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648988">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretion of SDF-1α Modulates Endothelial Function in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Endothelial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

Clinical trial results vary, however, and poor cell retention and survival after delivery likely limit the opportunity to exert beneficial effects. To overcome these limitations, we built an implantable intravascular bioreactor (IBR) designed to protect contained cells from washout, dilution, and immune attack while allowing sustained release of beneficial paracrine factors. Methods and Results IBRs were constructed using semipermeable membrane adhered to a clinical-grade catheter shaft. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) viability in and paracrine factor release from IBRs were assessed in vitro and IBR biocompatibility and immune protection confirmed in vivo. In a porcine anterior MI model, IBRs containing 25 million allogeneic MSCs (IBR-MSCs) were compared with IBRs containing media alone (IBR-Placebo; n=8 per group) with adverse remodeling assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Four weeks after MI, IBR-MSCs had no significant change in end-diastolic volume (+0.33±4.32 mL; P=0.89), end-systolic volume (+2.14±4.13 mL; P=0.21), and left ventricular ejection fraction (-2.27±2.94; P=0.33) while IBR-Placebo had significant increases in end-diastolic volume (+10.37±3.84 mL; P=0.01) and ESV (+11.35±2.88 mL; P=0.01), and a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (-5.78±1.70; P=0.025).

The complicated interaction between injured tubular cells, activated endothelial cells, and the immune system leads to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, thereby exacerbating the apoptosis of renal tubular cells and impeding the process of tissue repair. Stem cell therapy is an innovative approach to ameliorate IRI due to its antioxidative, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the biological effects and mechanisms of action of stem cell therapy in the context of acute ischemic AKI to improve its therapeutic benefits. The recent finding that treatment with conditioned medium (CM) derived from stem cells is likely an effective alternative to conventional stem cell transplantation increases the potential for future therapeutic uses of stem cell therapy. In this review, we discuss the recent findings regarding stem cell-mediated cytoprotection, with a focus on the anti-inflammatory effects via suppression of oxidative stress and uncompromised immune responses following AKI. Stem cell-derived CM represents a favorable approach to stem cell-based therapy and may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against acute ischemic AKI.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-24<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330934">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Deformation imaging to assess global and regional effects of cardiac regenerative therapy in ischaemic heart disease: A systematic review.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Currently, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most common endpoint in cardiovascular stem cell therapy research. However, this global measure of cardiac function might not be suitable to detect the regional effects sorted by this therapy and is hampered by high operator variability and loading dependency. Deformation imaging might be more accurate in detecting potential regional functional improvements by cardiac regenerative therapy. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current literature on the value of deformation imaging in cardiac regenerative therapy. A systematic review of current literature available on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed regarding both animal and patient studies in which deformation imaging was used to study cardiac cell therapy. After critical appraisal, outcomes regarding study design, type of cell therapy, procedural characteristics, outcome measure, method for measuring strain, and efficacy on both LVEF and deformation parameters were depicted. A total of 30 studies, 15 preclinical and 15 clinical, were included for analysis. Deformation outcomes improved significantly in 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and in 10 out of 15 clinical studies, whereas LVEF improved in 12 and 4 articles, respectively. Study designs and used deformation outcomes varied significantly among the included papers. Six studies found a positive effect on deformation outcomes without LVEF improvement. Hence, deformation imaging seems at least equal, and perhaps superior, to LVEF measurement in the assessment of cardiac regenerative therapy.

Despite the therapeutic potential of new drugs and small molecules, there remains a gap in the ability to efficiently deliver cardioprotective agents in a cell specific manner while minimizing nonspecific delivery to other organs. Exosomes derived from cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis, induce endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation and modulate cardiomyocyte apoptosis and hypertrophy. While innately cardioprotective at high doses, unmodified CDC-exosomes demonstrate limited cardiac tropism. To generate an efficient exosomal delivery system that can target cardiomyocytes, we engineered CDCs to express Lamp2b, an exosomal membrane protein, fused to a cardiomyocyte specific peptide (CMP), WLSEAGPVVTVRALRGTGSW. Exosomes isolated from engineered CDCs expressed CMP on their surface and retained their native physical properties. Targeted exosomes resulted in increased uptake by cardiomyocytes, decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and higher cardiac retention following intramyocardial injection when compared with non-targeted exosomes. Importantly, we established a novel targeting system to improve exosomal uptake by cardiomyocytes and laid the foundation for cell-specific exosomal delivery of drug and gene therapies to improve the functional capacity of the heart following both ischemic and non-ischemic injury.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-07-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296886">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3-engineered mesenchymal stromal cells attenuate cardiac impairment in mice with myocardial infarction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) transplantation offers an attractive alternative in myocardial infarctive therapy. However, poor cell engraftment and survival limit their restorative capacity. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) inhibits reverse remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) and was found to be secreted by MSCs in our preliminary experiments. We examined whether the overexpression of CTRP3 improved the survival of transplanted MSCs and augmented their efficacy on MI and whether silencing CTRP3 attenuated these effects. For gain-of-function analysis, MSCs overexpressing CTRP3 (LvC3-MSCs), control virus-transfected MSCs (LvNull-MSCs), MSCs alone, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the peripheral areas of the infarction immediately after coronary artery ligation. For loss-of-function analysis, mice subjected to MI were randomized into groups and administered CTRP3-knockdown MSCs (LvshC3-MSCs), Lvshctrl-MSCs, MSCs, or PBS. Survival rates, cardiac function, and myocardial remodeling in mice were evaluated after 4 weeks. Injection of MSCs or LvNull-MSCs improved the left ventricular ejection fraction, inhibited cardiac fibrosis, and regulated cellular profiles of the infarction border zone 4 weeks after MI compared with those in the PBS group.

However, their introduction into clinical practice has been associated with a suboptimal therapeutic profile. In this review, we address the biodistribution of MSCs in preclinical studies with a focus on the current understanding of the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MSCs as key aspects to overcome unsatisfactory clinical benefits of MSC application. Beginning with evidence of MSC biodistribution and highlighting PK and PD factors, a new PK-PD model is also proposed. According to this theory, MSCs and their released factors are key players in PK, and the efficacy biomarkers are considered relevant for PD in more predictive preclinical investigations. Accounting for the PK-PD relationship in MSC translational research and proposing new models combined with better biodistribution studies could allow realization of the promise of more robust MSC clinical translation.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236426">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Mesenchymal stem cell therapy induces FLT3L and CD1c<br><b>Abstract:</b> Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit immunoregulatory function in human autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.

Bioengineered artificial hearts generated by seeding of cells on decellularized scaffolds have been suggested as an alternative source for transplantation. This study aimed to develop a tissue-engineered heart with lower immunogenicity and functional similarity to a physiological heart that can be used for heart transplantation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to decellularize cardiac tissue to obtain a decellularized scaffold. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from rat bone marrow and identified by flow cytometric labeling of their surface markers. At the same time, the multi-directional differentiation of MSCs was analyzed. The MSCs, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes were allowed to adhere to the decellularized scaffold during perfusion, and the function of tissue-engineered heart was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and electrocardiogram.
RESULTS: MSCs, isolated from rats differentiated into cardiomyocytes, were seeded along with primary rat cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells onto decellularized rat heart scaffolds. We first confirmed the pluripotency of the MSCs, performed immunostaining against cardiac markers expressed by MSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and completed surface antigen profiling of MSC-derived endothelial cells. After cell seeding and culture, we analyzed the performance of the bioartificial heart by electrocardiography but found that the bioartificial heart exhibited abnormal electrical activity. The results indicated that the tissue-engineered heart lacked some cells necessary for the conduction of electrical current, causing deficient conduction function compared to the normal heart.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that MSCs derived from rats may be useful in the generation of a bioartificial heart, although technical challenges remain with regard to generating a fully functional bioartificial heart.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-05<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164131">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Inositol pyrophosphates mediated the apoptosis induced by hypoxic injury in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells by autophagy.<br><b>Abstract:</b> OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential effect of IP7 on the autophagy and apoptosis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) caused by hypoxia.
METHODS: BM-MSCs isolated from adult male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to normoxic condition and hypoxic stress for 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively. Then, flow cytometry detected the characteristics of BM-MSCs. Furthermore, N6-(p-nitrobenzyl) purine (TNP) was administrated to inhibit inositol pyrophosphates (IP7). TUNEL assay determined the apoptosis in BM-MSCs with hypoxia. Meanwhile, RFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid transfection and transmission microscope was used for measuring autophagy. In addition, Western blotting assay evaluated protein expressions.
RESULTS: Hypoxic injury increased the autophagy and apoptosis of BM-MSCs. At the same time, hypoxic injury enhanced the production of IP7. Moreover, hypoxia decreased the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. At last, TNP (inhibitor of IP7) repressed the increased autophagy and apoptosis of BM-MSCs under hypoxia.
CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that hypoxia increased autophagy and apoptosis via IP7-mediated Akt/mTOR signaling pathway of BM-MSCs.

The prognosis is generally poor. HF is most frequently related to cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease (CHD). Associated phenotypes are HF with preserved (HFpEF) or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); both in children with biventricular or univentricular circulation. Cardiac growth, differentiation, proliferation and consecutively regenerative and repair mechanisms are inversely related to the patient's age; edaphic and circulating cardiac progenitor cells as well; in sum, there are enormous endogenous potentials repairing a diseased heart in particular in young children. Efforts supporting pediatric cardiac regeneration are clearly justified; cell-based therapies have been addressed in small series of children with end-stage HF of either the left or right ventricle, more recently in randomized clinical trials. Different cell populations like autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells, progenitor cells or cardiac derived cells have been injected into coronaries or directly into the myocardium. Beneficial at least transient improvement of cardiac function was observed in patients with dilative cardiomyopathy and CHD, mainly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Cellular repopulation and possibly more crucial, paracrine effects contributed in slowing down progression of pediatric end-stage HF. Our review summarizes the current knowledge in different scenarios of HF by cell-based cardiac therapies in critically ill children. Based on the actual clinical experience future work to distinguish responders from non-responders among other refinements will lead to individualized precision treatment of HF in children, what means a lot to a child on a long list waiting for heart transplantation (HTX).<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-06-04<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161081">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Dose-dependent improvement of cardiac function in a swine model of acute myocardial infarction after intracoronary administration of allogeneic heart-derived cells.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Allogeneic cardiac-derived progenitor cells (CPC) without immunosuppression could provide an effective ancillary therapy to improve cardiac function in reperfused myocardial infarction. We set out to perform a comprehensive preclinical feasibility and safety evaluation of porcine CPC (pCPC) in the infarcted porcine model, analyzing biodistribution and mid-term efficacy, as well as safety in healthy non-infarcted swine.
METHODS: The expression profile of several pCPC isolates was compared with humans using both FACS and RT-qPCR. ELISA was used to compare the functional secretome. One week after infarction, female swine received an intracoronary (IC) infusion of vehicle (CON), 25 × 10
RESULTS: Phenotypic and functional characterization of pCPC revealed a gene expression profile comparable to their human counterparts as well as preliminary functional equivalence. Left ventricular functional and structural remodeling showed significantly increased LVEF 10 weeks after IC administration of 50 M pCPC, associated to the recovery of left ventricular volumes that returned to pre-infarction values (LVEF at 10 weeks was 42.1 ± 10.0% in CON, 46.5 ± 7.4% in 25 M, and 50.2 ± 4.9% in 50 M, p < 0.05). Infarct remodeling was also improved following pCPC infusion with a significantly higher myocardial salvage index in both treated groups (0.35 ± 0.20 in CON; 0.61 ± 0.20, p = 0.04, in 25 M; and 0.63 ± 0.17, p = 0.01, in 50 M). Biodistribution studies demonstrated cardiac tropism 4 h after IC administration, with substantial myocardial retention of pCPC-associated tracer activity (18% of labeled cells in the heart), and no obstruction of coronary flow, indicating their suitability as a cell therapy product.
CONCLUSIONS: IC administration of allogeneic pCPC at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction is feasible, safe, and associated with marked structural and functional benefit.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with their specific biological effects, have been applied in several clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy in HF therapy. We performed this meta-analysis to review the clinical evidence of their therapeutic effect on HF.
METHODS: Three databases were searched. The outcomes of interest were death, readmission, the 6-min walk test (6MWT), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were calculated to evaluate the effects of MSCs on HF compared to placebo.
RESULTS: A total of nine studies were included, involving 612 patients who underwent MSCs or placebo treatment. The overall rate of death showed a trend of reduction of 36% (RR [CI] = 0.64 [0.35, 1.16], p = 0.143) in the MSC treatment group. The incidence of readmission was reduced by 34% (RR [CI] = 0.66 [0.51, 0.85], p = 0.001). The patients in the MSC treatment group realised an average of 40.44 m (WMD [95% CI] = 40.44 m [19.07, 61.82], p < 0.0001) improvement in 6MWT. The NYHA class was reduced obviously in the MSC group (WMD [95% CI] = - 0.42 [- 0.64, - 0.20], p < 0.0001). The changes of LVEF from baseline were significantly more than 5.25% (WMD [95% CI] = 5.25 [3.58, 6.92], p < 0.0001) in the MSCs group, unlike in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that MSC treatment is an effective therapy for HF by improving the prognosis and exercise capacity. SCs derived from allosomes have superior therapeutic effects, and intracoronary injection is the optimum MSC delivery approach.

The adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) that it contains can be maintained and expanded in culture for long periods of time without losing their differentiation capacity, leading to large cell quantities being increasingly used in cell therapy purposes. Many reports showed that ADSCs-based cell therapy products demonstrated optimal efficacy and efficiency in some clinical indications for both autologous and allogeneic purposes, hence becoming considered as potential tools for replacing, repairing, and regenerating dead or damaged cells. In this review, we analyzed the therapeutic advancement of ADSCs in comparison to bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord (UC)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and designed the specific requirements to their best clinical practices and safety. Our analysis was focused on the ADSCs, rather than the whole stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell populations, to facilitate characterization that is related to their source of origins.

As such, clinical applications of MSCs are reliant on these cells successfully migrating to the desired tissue following their administration. Unfortunately, MSC homing is inefficient, with only a small percentage of cells reaching the target tissue following systemic administration. This attrition represents a major bottleneck in realizing the full therapeutic potential of MSC-based therapies. Accordingly, a variety of strategies have been employed in the hope of improving this process. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying MSC homing, based on a multistep model involving (1) initial tethering by selectins, (2) activation by cytokines, (3) arrest by integrins, (4) diapedesis or transmigration using matrix remodelers, and (5) extravascular migration toward chemokine gradients. We then review the various strategies that have been investigated for improving MSC homing, including genetic modification, cell surface engineering, in vitro priming of MSCs, and in particular, ultrasound techniques, which have recently gained significant interest. Contextualizing these strategies within the multistep homing model emphasizes that our ability to optimize this process hinges on our understanding of its molecular mechanisms. Moving forward, it is only with a combined effort of basic biology and translational work that the potential of MSC-based therapies can be realized.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-05-23<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121468">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived cells therapy on cardiomyopathy: a meta-analysis.<br><b>Abstract:</b> BACKGROUND: Controversial results still existed on the clinical utility of bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) for cardiomyopathy (CMP). This study aims to reveal the true power of this promising approach by synthesizing all the available data on this subject matter.
METHODS: Twenty studies including 1418 patients were identified from systematic search. Weighted mean differences for changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), 6-min walk distance, and NYHA functional class were estimated with a random-effects model. Major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), rehospitalization, all-cause mortality, and patients' quality of life were also calculated.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, BMC therapy resulted in greater LVEF (3.72%, 95% CI 2.31 to 5.13, P < 0.0001), 6-min walk distance (53.16, 95% CI 25.17 to 81.10, P = 0.0002), NYHA functional class (- 0.48, 95% CI - 0.65 to - 0.31, P < 0.0001), and smaller LVESV (- 16.79, 95% CI - 27.21 to - 6.38, P = 0.002). BMC treatment significantly reduced the mortality rate and improved patients' quality of life. No significant difference was found between the BMCs and control group in LVEDV, MACE, and rehospitalization rate. However, the outcomes showed a clear trend in favor of the BMC group. Subgroup analysis showed that LVEF improved greater in a subgroup of intracoronary infusion, BMSC, or higher cell dose.
CONCLUSION: The results of the current meta-analysis suggest that BMC treatment for CMP is safe and feasible.

The current study aimed to detect the ability of BM-MSCs to improve kidney and cardiac functions in adult rats with established chronic kidney disease.
Methods: Rats were divided into sham-operated control, untreated sub totally nephrectomised and treated sub totally nephrectomised groups. Body weight, kidney and cardiac tissue weights, plasma creatinine and urea levels and arterial blood pressure were measured. ECG was recorded, and an in vitro isolated heart study was performed.
Results: Stem cell treatment decreased the elevated plasma creatinine and urea levels and decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure values. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in glomerular hypertrophy with apparent normal renal parenchyma. Additionally, BM-MSCs shortened Q-To and Q-Tc intervals, all time to peak tension values, the half relaxation value at 30 min of reperfusion and the contraction time at 15 and 30 min of reperfusion. Moreover, stem cell treatment significantly increased the heart rate, QRS voltage, the peak tension at the 15- and 30-min reperfusion time points and the peak tension per left ventricle at the 30-min reperfusion time point compared to the pre-ischaemia baseline. BM-MSCs resolve inter muscular oedema and lead to the re-appearance of normal cardiomyocytes. This improvement occurs with the observations of BM-MSCs in renal and heart tissues.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Comorbidities in Preclinical Stroke Research.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Stroke is a major health problem worldwide. It has been estimated that 90% of the population attributable risk of stroke is due to risk factors such as aging, hypertension, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus and obesity, among others. However, most animal models of stroke use predominantly healthy and young animals. These models ignore the main comorbidities associated with cerebrovascular disease, which could be one explanation for the unsuccessful bench-to-bedside translation of protective and regenerative strategies by not taking the patient's situation into account. This lack of success makes it important to incorporate comorbidities into animal models of stroke in order to study the effects of the various therapeutic strategies tested. Regarding cell therapy, the administration of stem cells in the acute and chronic phases has been shown to be safe and effective in experimental animal models of stroke.

Currently, stem cells are being investigated for their potentially widespread use in therapies for many untreatable diseases. Nowadays modern treatment strategies willingly use mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from different sources. Researchers are increasingly aware of the nature of MSCs and new possibilities for their use. Due to their properties, especially their ability to self-regenerate, differentiate into several cell lineages and participate in immunomodulation, MSCs have become a promising tool in developing modern and efficient future treatment strategies. The great potential and availability of MSCs allow for their various clinical applications in the treatment of many incurable diseases. In addition to their many advantages and benefits, there are still questions about the use of MSCs. What are the mechanisms of action of MSCs? How do they reach their destination? Is the clinical use of MSCs safe? These are the main questions that arise regarding MSCs when they are considered as therapeutic tools. The diversity of MSCs, their different clinical applications, and their many traits that have not yet been thoroughly investigated are sources of discussions and controversial opinions about these cells.

The existing innate and adaptive immune barriers restricting oncolytic virotherapy, however, can be overcome using autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells as carrier cells with unique immunosuppressive properties.
METHODS: To test the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to overcome innate and adaptive immune barriers and to successfully deliver oncolytic vaccinia virus to tumor cells, we performed flow cytometry and virus plaque assay analysis of ex vivo co-cultures of stem cells infected with vaccinia virus in the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Comparative analysis was performed to establish statistically significant correlations and to evaluate the effect of stem cells on the activity of key immune cell populations.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have the potential to eradicate resistant tumor cells through a combination of potent virus amplification and sensitization of the tumor cells to virus infection. Moreover, the ADSCs demonstrate ability to function as a virus-amplifying Trojan horse in the presence of both autologous and allogeneic human PBMCs, which can be linked to the intrinsic immunosuppressive properties of stem cells and their unique potential to overcome innate and adaptive immune barriers. The clinical application of ready-to-use ex vivo expanded allogeneic stem cell lines, however, appears significantly restricted by patient-specific allogeneic differences associated with the induction of potent anti-stem cell cytotoxic and IFNγ responses. These allogeneic responses originate from both innate (NK)- and adaptive (T)- immune cells and might compromise therapeutic efficacy through direct elimination of the stem cells or the induction of an anti-viral state, which can block the potential of the Trojan horse to amplify and deliver vaccinia virus to the tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings and data indicate the feasibility to establish simple and informative assays that capture critically important patient-specific differences in the immune responses to the virus and stem cells, which allows for proper patient-stem cell matching and enables the effective use of off-the-shelf allogeneic cell-based delivery platforms, thus providing a more practical and commercially viable alternative to the autologous stem cell approach.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-28<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917829">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Micro- and Macrovascular Complications in Diabetes Mellitus: Preclinical and Clinical Studies.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-03-26<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911551">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Rethinking Endothelial Dysfunction as a Crucial Target in Fighting Heart Failure.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by nitric oxide dysregulation and an altered redox state.

We sought to compare the safety and efficacy of direct intramyocardial transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs) in a porcine model of HF.
METHODS: Eight weeks after induction of HF with myocardial infarction (MI) and rapid pacing, animals with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were randomly assigned to receive direct intramyocardial injection of saline (MI group), 2 × 10
RESULTS: At 8 weeks post-transplantation, LVEF, left ventricular maximal positive pressure derivative, and end systolic pressure-volume relationship were significantly higher in the hiPSC-MSC group but not in the hESC-CM group compared with the MI group. The incidence of early spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) episodes was higher in the hESC-CM group but the incidence of inducible VT was similar among the different groups. Histological examination showed no tumor formation but hiPSC-MSCs exhibited a stronger survival capacity by activating regulatory T cells and reducing the inflammatory cells. In vitro study showed that hiPSC-MSCs were insensitive to pro-inflammatory interferon-gamma-induced human leukocyte antigen class II expression compared with hESC-CMs. Moreover, hiPSC-MSCs also significantly enhanced angiogenesis compared with other groups via increasing expression of distinct angiogenic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that transplantation of hiPSC-MSCs is safe and does not increase proarrhythmia or tumor formation and superior to hESC-CMs for the improvement of cardiac function in HF.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that can be isolated from various human tissues, with multipotent and immunomodulatory characteristics to help damaged tissue repair and avoidance of immune responses. Much research has proved the feasibility, safety, and efficiency of MSC-based therapy for cardiovascular disease. Despite the fact that the precise mechanism of MSCs remains unclear, their therapeutic capability to treat ischemic diseases has been tested in phase I/II clinical trials. MSCs have the potential to become an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular disorders. The molecular mechanism underlying the efficacy of MSCs in promoting engraftment and accelerating the functional recovery of injury sites is still unclear. It is hypothesized that the mechanisms of paracrine effects for the cardiac repair, optimization of the niche for cell survival, and cardiac remodeling by inflammatory control are involved in the interaction between MSCs and the damaged myocardial environment.

Developments in the diagnosis and management of rare diseases have been relatively slow due to a lack of sufficient profit motivation and market to attract research by companies. However, due to the attention of government and society as well as economic development, rare diseases have been gradually become an increasing concern. As several dental-craniofacial manifestations are associated with rare diseases, we summarize them in this study to help dentists and oral maxillofacial surgeons provide an early diagnosis and subsequent management for patients with these rare diseases.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-02-20<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30783081">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Immunomodulatory Functions of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Tissue Engineering.<br><b>Abstract:</b> The inflammatory response to chronic injury affects tissue regeneration and has become an important factor influencing the prognosis of patients. In previous stem cell treatments, it was revealed that stem cells not only have the ability for direct differentiation or regeneration in chronic tissue damage but also have a regulatory effect on the immune microenvironment. Stem cells can regulate the immune microenvironment during tissue repair and provide a good "soil" for tissue regeneration. In the current study, the regulation of immune cells by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the local tissue microenvironment and the tissue damage repair mechanisms are revealed. The application of the concepts of "seed" and "soil" has opened up new research avenues for regenerative medicine. Tissue engineering (TE) technology has been used in multiple tissues and organs using its biomimetic and cellular cell abilities, and scaffolds are now seen as an important part of building seed cell microenvironments. The effect of tissue engineering techniques on stem cell immune regulation is related to the shape and structure of the scaffold, the preinflammatory microenvironment constructed by the implanted scaffold, and the material selection of the scaffold. In the application of scaffold, stem cell technology has important applications in cartilage, bone, heart, and liver and other research fields. In this review, we separately explore the mechanism of MSCs in different tissue and organs through immunoregulation for tissue regeneration and MSC combined with 3D scaffolds to promote MSC immunoregulation to repair damaged tissues.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-02-15<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30766609">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Treatment of sarcopenia: the road to the future.<br><b>Abstract:</b> None<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2019-01-30<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697982">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> mi R -15a/15b Cluster Modulates Survival of Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Improve Its Therapeutic Efficacy of Myocardial Infarction.<br><b>Abstract:</b> Background The poor viability of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hampers their therapeutic efficacy for ischemic heart disease.

Although conventional treatments show modest benefits, pilot and phase I/II trials with bone marrow (BM) and adipose-derived (AD) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) point to the feasibility, safety, and occurrence of clinical and structural improvement in focal or diffuse disease. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the intra-articular injection of single or repeated umbilical cord-derived (UC) MSCs in knee OA. UC-MSCs were cultured in an International Organization for Standardization 9001:2015 certified Good Manufacturing Practice-type Laboratory.

On the other hand, research on the method of cell transplantation has developed from the administration of cell suspensions to cell-sheet engineering and 3D technology. In the trend, a cell transplantation platform named CellSaic, which is a combination of xeno-free recombinant scaffolds in a cell aggregate-like shape, was developed. CellSaic is the cell transplantation platform that can prevent the central necrosis within cell aggregates by arranging the cells and petaloid pieces of recombinant peptide (RCP) in a mosaic. The prevention of central necrosis is the most significant advantage over other 3D culture systems. This review details the unique characteristics of CellSaic including safety examination results and describes its future application for MSC transplantation. Particularly, in the application of MSCs, it has been reported that the MSC CellSaics increased the effect on improving various symptoms compared with MSCs only in the application of the therapy to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cerebral infarction, bone cartilage regeneration in joints, and islet transplantation. In accordance with the "One Health" concept, it is anticipated that this technology is expected to contribute to companion animal therapy and human therapy in the future.<br><b>Publication date:</b> 2018-09-12<br><b><a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30207243">Link</a></b><br><br><br><h2>Patents</h2> <br><br><b>Title:</b> Methods to improve cell therapy<br><b>Abstract:</b> Methods of treatment are provided herein, including administration of a population cells modified to enforce expression of an E-selectin and/or an L-selectin ligand, the modified cell population having a cell viability of at least 70% after a treatment to enforce such expression.<br><b>Patent date:</b> November 12, 2019<br><b>File date:</b> December 29, 2015<br><b><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=(%22heart+failure%22+AND+%22allogeneic+mesenchymal+stem+cells%22)&OS="heart+failure"+AND+"allogeneic+mesenchymal+stem+cells"&RS=("heart+failure"+AND+"allogeneic+mesenchymal+stem+cells")">Link</a></b><br><br><b>Title:</b> Management of ischemia using pooled mesenchymal stromal cell composition<br><b>Abstract:</b> The present disclosure relates to composition comprising pooled and expanded allogeneic mesenchymal Stromal cells (MSCs) and a method for management of Ischemia using the composition thereof.
